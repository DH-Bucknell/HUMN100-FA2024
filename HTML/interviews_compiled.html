               I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't stand it any longer. I was
               going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed, went down to my
               <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="house">grandmother's room</span> and I said, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby">"Mama,</span> I am going over to say 'goodbye' to Mr taylor,"
               and she advised me not to do it. She said it was too late: "Do you know it is nearly
               <time type="12oclock" instant="false">twelve o'clock?</time>" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I
               just must do so," I said, "I realize that this is not the usual thing and I have
               never been there so late, but I must do so, Mama. I am going to give him a

               She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would get up and go with you, but I don't
               feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on

               the time; every time I was with him I would say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't
               see him and today I am with him," and things like that. So I <time instant="false">arrived at five

            <p part="N"> MINTER: I had always known that this was just
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes"> an exquisite chapter in my
                  life</eventName> that must necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part
               with it; it was just a beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the. world today as I
               see it, as it is forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">him</span>; I had always been a 
               <persName instant="false" full="yes">reserved,
                  very retiring young girl</persName>, and he was the first man and the only man who
               ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented that
               to
               me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any of my ideals
               that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first formulated he said
               to
               me, "Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December, and this is not right.
               I
               know it is best that we must part." This was at the very beginning of it, and I said,
               "Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold thing; I couldn't try to withhold
               a person's love for me who didn't care for me."" I said, "I know that you are many
               years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody as I love you. I simply love you.
               And
               we did try to part, We tried it again and again, and then he would beoome ill. At
               one
               time I had almost resolved to see him no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else
               cared, [page 6] really cared whether he ate his 
               <objectName instant="false" full="yes">dinner</objectName> or
               whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of himself, and I couldn't
               bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of sweetheart, but I wanted to be his
               nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was aching. I wanted him to tell me his
               mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let me soothe them away for him as I would
               for a little child. I forgot the man's age; it meant nothing to me. The only thing
               I
               wanted was to serve him as I would have served the Lord or a little child, and then
               it just passed away; for months at a time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why.
               Finally, I decided there was no use; it must come to an end and I went there on the
               night of the 23d to give him this letter telling him "goodbye." I had reason to
               believe, in the awful vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went
               there to say "goodbye" myself. He said, "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?" when
               he
               opened the door. I said, "Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you?
               You know Mama has been sick for three months and you have been ill and I have been
               frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call me to tell me that
               you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo that things are all
               right." </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> I said, "I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it
               wouldn't have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not
               leave me in the dark." He said, "Mary, I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and
               I
               can't explain it to you." Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times,
               Mr
               Doran, that the words just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it
               to you as it really is. There is so much more to it.</p>

            <p part="N">MINTER: My last director was <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="urson">Frank Urson</span>. <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">Mr. Taylor</span> so often, often made the remark to me that he
               wished tbat he were younger; he wanted to be younger. We undoubtedly would have been
               married today bnd he been younger. <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">He</span> explained our
               not. being engaged in that way. I knew we never could be married; I also knew I never
               would love for another human being in the way I cared for him. So he would say, "You
               know, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">Mary</span>, to me you are the morning sun, bright,
               beaut1ful, and with the world and a futune before you, and I am the setting sun, and
               don't you see, my dear, it simply cannot be. I hope tbat doesn't give you the
               impression that I begged him to marry me. I never did in my life. I couldn't do that.
               I never even called him <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">"Billie"</span> in my life. The
               man was too wonderful for that. He was wonderful. I don't care what anybody says or
               what they prove against him. I knew him as the finest thing in the world. </p>

            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes, and I can aay now that I can't truthfully -- I don't know any of those
               ugly things which have been aaid about him. I never found him so. He was glorious
               to
               me. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> MR DORAN: I read in the <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="document">paper</span> where you had

               and the

            <p part="N">MINTER: That is not true. <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="dickson">Mr Dickson</span> is the only

               despondency.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">DORAN: What about <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="neilan">Marshall Neilan</span>? Were you engaged

               stay with this one or that one. He flits here and there like a swallow. We are all

            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes; that is, I didn't exactly say, "No, I will not marry you." I didn't take

            <p part="N">DORAN: How many times after that did <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">he</span> mention the

               and thought no more of it. </p>

            <p part="N"> STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 4] <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> said that to me, and looked right at me. I
               could feel myself grow red. I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor</span>?" He said, "Well, I could recite some more
               instances about <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Bill's</span> seeming insanity." He said,
               "I am certain he was insane. He stood up and told those things as 
               <eventName type="sober" instant="false" full="yes">soberly</eventName> as I am talking to you now." </p>
            
            <p part="N"> MR MOTT: Excuse me. Did he refer to <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor's</span>
               physical condition? </p>
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: Yes, he said he was 
               <eventName type="drunk" instant="false" full="yes">drunk</eventName> at the time.
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> has told ma on several occasions,
               sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he always hated to see <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Bill</span> drink because he said, "You wouldn't know the man; he
               changes so; he gets maudlin and silly, smiles in a foolish manner and wobbles and
               talks, oh, just the silly, foolish things." He said, "None of his friends like to
               see
               him drink." At this time he was 
               <eventName type="drunk" instant="false" full="yes">intoxicated</eventName> and
               he talked on and on and on about this thing." <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> said he got up and he told <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">
                  Bill</span>, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with your mind. I would
               certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were crazy," and that was
               tbe opinion of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Arthur">Arthur Hoyt</span> and <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Robinson">Cap Robinson</span> and everybody. They were perfectly amazed
               that a man of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor's</span> lovable, sweet,
               considerate, gentlemanly disposition all through life should suddenly turn around
               and
               say this about not only a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and
               respected. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> When I heard of this thing, l just looked to <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> and said, "Is that all you have to tell me about <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor</span>?" And he said, "Yes, that is all. That 1s the
               ghastly thing. I know you are going to hear this from somebody and I wanted you to
               hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew about the 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murder</eventName> of this man." </p>
            
            <p part="N"> By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted with
               shock, one shock after another and of all the shocks I had received, this coming from
               hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not as I knew
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor</span>, I couldn't believe for an instant he
               had ever said these things to anybody, yet there <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> giving me names, dates and places. The thing was too much for
               me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't believe you! I think you are lying! How dare
               you say this about him to me! I never want to see you again?" He got up and walked
               around the room for a minute and I was just broiling; I was just furious; and he
               turned around and he said, "Well, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Mary">Mary</span>, some day you
               will realize that I certainly am not saying this for any personal reason. It hurts
               me
               as it must hurt you. I am simply telling you because you are bound to know it; it
               is
               the truth and I wanted to be the one to tell you. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious with
               him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things about, "You
               know <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Mary">Mary</span> that I care for you." </p>
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: He told you he loved you, did he? </p>
            
            <p part="N">MINTER: Yes; he did on 
               <date type="Friday" instant="false">Friday</date> night. He said, "You know I
               care for you deeply." </p>
            
            <p part="N"> I said, "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Jones">John Jones</span> to care for me or anybody; I don't want ever to
               be in 
               <eventName type="love" instant="false" full="yes">love</eventName> again as long as I 
               <eventName type="life" instant="false" full="yes">live</eventName>; I don't want to see any man; I hate men." I probably
               raved on. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> I dont know what more I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting
               up all <time type="night" instant="false">night</time>. This conversation didn't come as quickly as I
               am te11ing it to you. It came with long pauses; he would get up and walk around with
               his <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="cigarette">cigarette</span> smoking and come back again
               and go out and talk to the property man, go out of the 
               <placeName instant="false" full="yes">office</placeName>,
               and I would sit there alone and I tore a piece of paper, I was so tired, and
               suggested that we go <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="home">home</span>. I said, "Why keep
               sitting up? </p>
            
            <p part="N"> You have got to get up at <time type="morning" instant="false">eight o'clock</time> in the <time type="morning" instant="false">morning</time> and it is nearly <time type="morning" instant="false">dawn</time>."
               He aaid, "I am worried about this thing; I want to find out what you know about this
               
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murder</eventName>." Then it developed that <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> thought I knew something about it, and he
               looked at me and he said, "Now, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Mary">Mary</span>" -- he got a
               little profane, he said, "Now, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Mary">Mary</span>, for God's sake,
               if you know anything about the 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murder</eventName> of
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Bill</span> tell it to me now." He said, "Don't
               withhold anything." This was too much; not only had he been telling me these things
               about <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor</span>, but there he sat evidently
               believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think that I 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">killed</eventName>
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor</span>?" He said, "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now
               is no time to talk things like that. " He said, "I am just trying to find something
               out about this. This is going to be an awful 
               <eventName type="affair" instant="false" full="yes">affair</eventName>." I said, "I didn't 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">kill</eventName>
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</span> and I don't know who
               
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murdered</eventName> him." He said, "You don't? You don't
               know anything?" He said, "Of course, you didn't 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">kill</eventName> him; of course, you didn't put anybody on to do it, But" he
               said, "don't you know somebody, don't you know some inti­mate details that other
               people might not know? Can't you rack your brain and think who would have a motive
               for 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">killing</eventName> him?" </p>
            
            <p part="N"> Then he sat there and we said words about pro and con, trying to think, and I
               thought over everyrody I knew and I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I
               said, "The only person I know who could have had a possible motive for 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">killing</eventName> him would be <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Ivers">Mrs. Julia
                  Crawford Ivers</span>." I was not serious when I said that. I was more or less
               humorous. She is a lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done me a
               wrong thing in her life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she is
               a
               <span xmlns="" class="entity orgName" data-hover="Christian">Christian Science lady</span> who has been associated
               with him as a <span xmlns="" class="entity orgName" data-hover="writer">scenario writer</span> for <time type="years" instant="false">many years</time>; she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very
               honorable respectable woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but
               we
               don't like each other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there
               and
               she had a strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is little
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Mary">Mary</span>. Here she comes." She would go on in this
               manner, "Oh, there is little <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Mary">Mary</span> again, Oh, there
               she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh." Quite a strange
               attitude, She just riled me. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: Bow old a woman was she? </p>
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr
                  Taylor's</span>
               <span xmlns="" class="entity orgName" data-hover="cameraman">camera man</span>. <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Jimmy">Jimmy</span> was my <span xmlns="" class="entity orgName" data-hover="cameraman">camera man</span>, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Jim">Jim Vantrees</span>. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me. She
               is one of the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of fate
               it
               was when I was in <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="France">France</span> after looking at the
               beautifUl Venus de Milo in <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="France">Paris</span> at the
               <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="France">Louvre</span>, and after I had walked a few steps
               done a long hall, thinking of this excellent statue, who should I see but <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Ivers">Julia Crawford Ivers</span>, a very, fat, large woman. She did
               some more of these <span xmlns="" class="entity orgName" data-hover="Christian">Christian Science things</span>, and
               she had a very unpleasant habit of whenever she would be with me and <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor</span>, she would always come and twit my chin. So I
               said, in really a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I don't
               think she had anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who would
               kill him but <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Ivers">Ju1ia Crawford Ivers</span>." "I always
               suspected the woman of being in love with him herself or she might have 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">killed</eventName> him tor that reason." He said, "My goodness! You
               mustn't say that out loud; somebody w111 believe you." I said, "I don't care if they
               do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, -- What else did we talk about? Oh! He talked
               about his <span xmlns="" class="entity orgName" data-hover="production">productions</span> and said, "I certainly
               have a terrible time, working <time type="day" instant="false">day</time> and <time type="night" instant="false">night</time> and a great deal depended upon 
               <date type="Saturday" instant="false">Saturday</date>
               and we must get certain work finished 
               <date type="Friday" instant="false">Friday</date>." We talked
               of 
               <date type="Friday" instant="false">Friday</date>
               <time type="night" instant="false">night</time> and that he had to get up at <time type="morning" instant="false">eight o'clock</time>; he wasn't going to bed at all; that the boys were calling
               for him at <time type="morning" instant="false">eight o'clock</time>, he said, and he knew if they
               didn't call he would never get up out of his 
               <eventName type="sleep" instant="false" full="yes">slumbers</eventName>. They were going somewhere <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="set">on
                  location</span>, I understood, possibly at the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="studio">studio</span>. He was just going <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="home">home</span> and
               take a 
               <eventName type="bathe" instant="false" full="yes">shower</eventName>, get a 
               <eventName type="bathe" instant="false" full="yes">shave</eventName> if he felt like it, and go on back and 
               <eventName type="work" instant="false" full="yes">work</eventName> some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so exhausted,
               just 
               <eventName type="dead" instant="false" full="yes">dead</eventName>." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this
               looks awful, being here all this time?" And he said, "I can't help it if it does.
               I
               had to tell you these things and wanted to find out what you knew about this case.
               That I know you knew <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Bill</span> very well, probably
               better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me to tel1 him my feelings
               toward <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor">Mr Taylor</span>, exactly what everybody has been
               asking me, and I told him as I have been telling you, I loved him deeply, sincerely
               and absolutely; that I 
               <eventName type="love" instant="false" full="yes">loved</eventName> him truly, 
               <eventName type="love" instant="false" full="yes">loved</eventName> him in an all-around way, I cared for his health;
               his health came before my happiness and when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see
               anyone when he was 
               <eventName type="sick" instant="false" full="yes">ill</eventName>-- my natural impulse was to
               go to him and be with him and sit up <time type="night" instant="false">night</time> after <time type="night" instant="false">night</time> with him, if necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even
               attempt to, because he didn't want me to, and although I had sat in the dark, not
               knowing anything and worrying about it, I did that rather than intrude myself upon
               him when he didn't want me. </p>

               out of here. I am burning up alive." It was very cold when we came in the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="home">house</span> and we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I
               don't know what was the matter with me, I wouldn't take off my <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="clothes">coat</span>. He said, "If you are going to stay there and

               and drove around for a while. No, it is not a fact that he said in the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="home">house</span>, "We must go to the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="studio">studio</span> and talk." I think I said that at first; it is not so. He
               said, "Let's go out and talk." Then it was very bitterly cold <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="outside">outside</span>, freez1ng ocld. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: You left the rest of the party at the house? </p>

            <p part="N"> MINTER: Yes; we

               <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="Hollywood">Sunset Boulevard</span> and went up -- We went

            <p part="N"> DORAN: What did you discuss while you were

            <p part="N"> MINTER: Why, about this thing about<span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Taylor"> Mr Taylor</span> and
               then also I was rather peeved na <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> at the
               time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly the word. That
               sounds more as if I am interested in <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span>,
               and I am; I like him, but l wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, "Well,
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span>, it was not a very nice thing the way
               you ran off the last time. I understood they were going out to 
               <eventName type="dinner" instant="false" full="yes">dinner</eventName> and you were coming to my <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="home">house</span> to 
               <eventName type="dinner" instant="false" full="yes">dinner</eventName> and suddenly you
               went to <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="hollywood">San Francisco</span> without so much as a
               fare-thee-well."' He said, "You know I do those things." I said, "Yes, you do those
               things, and it ts very annoying, but your friends love you and love you yet in spite
               of those funny little tricks you do, darting here and there. I don't know, I am in
               no
               mood to take thia foolishness; I want good wholesome friendship, but I want to know
               when you are going to appear." Many times a whole 
               <eventName type="dinner" instant="false" full="yes">dinner</eventName> has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a 
               <eventName type="dinner" instant="false" full="yes">dinner party</eventName> at our <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="home">house</span>, or other people have given 
               <eventName type="party" instant="false" full="yes">parties</eventName>, they have waited on <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="Marshall">Marshall</span> for <time type="hours" instant="false">two or three hours</time> and he
               finally would come along smiling sweetly at everybody and they couldn't scold him.
               I
               was more or less taking him to task for his 1ife in general, saying he should not
               do
               those things; it was very annoying and I was not going to put up with it. He was
               sweet and Irish and said, "You wouldn't be angry with me?" And I said, "No, I
               wouldn't be." That is the way we got out of that. There was nothing serious in the
               talk, Just the way we always talked. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: Then you finally went to the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="studio">studio</span>? </p>
            
            <p part="N"> MINTER: Finally he said, "Now, I have got something very important to tell you,
               something that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11
               go in the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="studio">studio</span> and talk." Our teeth were
               chatter1ng with cold and we went in there and he turned on the steam and I sat in
               this <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="clothes">fur coat</span> in a <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="chair">wicker chair</span>, and he said, "This is going to b, a nine or
               "nineteen-days talk of the world" Then he told me all the things I have been telling
               you. There may have been some more, and some thlngs I have said may not be exactly
               accurate, but the gist of the thing is entirely accurate. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: Did he declare his

            <p part="N"> MINTER: Not until after we had been there a long time at the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="studio">studio</span>. </p>
            
            <p part="N"> DORAN: Was it before or after he told you about this instance in connection with

            <p part="N"> MINTER: It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he
               was
               as sincere as he could be, and he can be very sincere, I am sure. I am sure he can.

               I don't remember 
               <persName instant="false" full="yes">his</persName> name, but I believe it be­gan with "S", and
               this <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="neilan">man</span>, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="neilan">Marshall</span> said he was the <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="neilan">big man</span>

As well as I remember, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="neilan">Marshall</span> said, "I then sent <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="document">them</span> to the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="studio">Realart Studio</span> and

Taylor</span>, whose tragic death caused a temporary suspension of
               much work planned.</p>
            
            <p part="N">"<span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">Mr. Taylor</span> was a splendid <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">picture</span> director," said <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="ivers">Miss
                  Ivers</span>. "He was a man of fine attainments. He was sympathetic and those
               who worked with and under his direction regarded him as one with whom it was a
               pleasure to be associated.</p>
            
            <p part="N">"My own work as a scenario writer was pleasurable from the fact that there was
               co-operation. He wanted the best and we desired to give him only the best. He was

               will be a loss to it, for he was of a constructive type, doing the best with the
               highest class of material."</p>
            
            <p part="N">It was partly because of his death that <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="ivers">Miss Ivers</span>
               dropped her own activities for a time, superinduced by a cold, resulting in the end
               in a determination to visit <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="state">Hawaii</span>, with
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="lasky">Mr. Lasky's</span> injunction that she delve into
               Hawaiian legends and find whether any of them can be filmed.</p>
            
            <p part="N"><span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="ivers">Miss Ivers</span> is at the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="state">Seaside

               dictating morning and afternoon. She is going here and there where details of
               Hawaiian life may be learned.</p>
            
            <p part="N">If such a motion <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">picture</span>play is to be
               written it may not deal entirely with legends, but legends may be woven into a modern
               type of play. The story of the Goddess Pele
               <persName instant="false" full="yes"></persName>, who dwells in <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="set">Kilauea volcano</span>, has attracted much of her attention and
               her own visit to the volcano in a week or so will have that much more interest for
               her. There is a dramatic, tragic, firey element in Pele
               <persName instant="false" full="yes"></persName> which may be
               converted to the screen, in her opinion.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> Much of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="ivers">Miss Ivers'</span> work at the studio in Los
               Angeles is associated directly with literary folk, writers of <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">books</span> whose names are known throughout the reading
               world--<span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="parker">Sir Gilbert Parker</span>, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="maugham">Sydney [sic] Maugham</span>, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="glyn">Elinor

               who takes their <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">books</span> and prepares or
               directs the preparation of scenarios for the director.</p>
            
            <p part="N">It is this contact between the scenario writer and the authors that counts for
               success or failure in the motion <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">picture</span>
               product. If the scenario writer is sympathetic and endeavors to get the soul of the
               author's intent, there are exceptional possibilities. If not, there is more likely
               to
               be a failure in the interpretation.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> Many <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">books</span> to be screened must be ripped
               to pieces. As the story is written it can seldom be filmed. The change is the task
               of
               the scenario writer.</p>
            
            <p part="N">Life must have been lived by scenario writers to really interpret a story for the
               screen for the eyes of the millions of theater patrons. Phases of life that are near
               the raw edge of actuality and realism may not be interpreted by the old maid who has
               not seen life and whose first impulse, and probably her last, is to eliminate that
               particular phase. A man of sensual thought may regard that particular phase as one
               to
               work into a maudlin interpretation which would be offensive.</p>
            
            <p part="N"> Between these two extremes there is the middle course and that path must be taken
               by
               the writer who understands life and understands the multiplicity of types and
               characters that patronize the theaters.</p>

               her, for both play important parts in decisions as to the worth of stories and the

               last spring, at which time I gathered material for the scenario, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="lasky">Mr. Lasky</span> asked me if the <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">picture</span> could not be produced on <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="set">the
                  mainland</span>. 'I'll read you the story,' I replied, and I did. He had
               nothing more to say, and here we are ready to work.</p>
            
            <p part="N">While the <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">picture</span> was not planned with the
               specific idea of giving publicity to <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="set">the islands</span>,
               it still will be of tremendous benefit in portraying to mainland people the marvels
               of this section of the globe. It will be a true mirror in which those of the outer
               world may see life as it is lived in the Paradise of the Pacific.</p>

               No
               'roughneck' of a director will have a chance to squeeze the fragrance out of the
               plot, for I am going to direct the action myself. It is some time since I did that
               sort of work, but I have chosen my cast and staff myself. I know something of the
               atmosphere of <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="state">Hawaii</span> and I wrote the story
               myself. I am just sure that if we can get things into film as we see them here the
               island will owe us a very great deal of gratitude.</p>

               I was not leaving a host of friends either, but there is something about the strains
               of 'Aloha Oe' which brings the moisture to the eyes and a catch to the throat. This
               atmosphere is what we hope to catch in our <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="possession">picture</span>, and we hope that when it comes back to <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="set">Honolulu </span>as a finished product the people will think that

            <p part="N">In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby">Mrs. Charlotte Shelby</span>, mother of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">Mary Miles Minter</span>, last night for the first time revealed hitherto
               unknown phases of 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">the <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">William Desmond
                     Taylor</span> murder case</eventName>. From the wealth of memories so
               closely associated with the career of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">her talented
                  daughter</span> she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many
               investigations that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murder of the film director</eventName> -- a case famous the world
               over. "The time for action has come. I'm not going to sit idly and be a target for
               base rumors and vicious innuendo. there must be some justice in this world -- even
               for a helpless woman." Breaking a silence of more than seven eventful years,
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</span>, one of the dramatic and
               ever-interesting figures of 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">the Taylor case</eventName>,
               thus struck back at the endless chain of "whispers and theories" linking her, as well
               as others, in the events of that 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">baffling
                  mystery</eventName>. Of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">Mary Miles Minter</span>, who
               was a film star under <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">Taylor</span>'s direction, she had
               little to say. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N">What here is disclosed would remain forever in her own <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="bodyPart">heart</span>, she said, were it not for the rumors, reports and
               insinuations that are making her life a dreadful dream. Desiring only to be left
               alone,<span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby"> Mrs. Shelby</span> now feels that she must cut
               through the web of whispers and suspicions to bring to an end the repetitions of her
               name in connection with the 
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">case</eventName>. And she wants to serve notice that every recourse
               of law will be brought to bear to stop unwarranted bantering of her name and to force
               those who have used it to come out in the open. "I have made complete statements to
               the <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="police">proper authorities</span> in the past and I stand
               ready to do it again if it will help in a sincere and honest effort to solve
               
               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">the mystery</eventName> of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor's</span> death," <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</span> said in
               the 
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">interview</eventName>. "But somewhere, somehow, this thing has got to
               stop. I demand it. We cannot go through life like this -- I and my <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">daughter</span>, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="mshelby">Margaret</span>. We
               are not hiding from anyone one anything. All we ask is to be left alone, and somebody
               has got to help us fight this terrible thing." For the purpose of an earnest and
               legitimate investigation, <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</span> revealed for
               the first time to THE EXAMINER <time instant="false">last night</time> that -- She was not in love
               with <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">William Desmond Taylor</span>. She did not make
               threats against the <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">famous director</span>.</p>
            
            
            
            <p part="N">She did not go to <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">Taylor</span>'s <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="residence">bungalow</span> at <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="address">404B South
                  Alvarado Street</span> at an <time instant="false">early morning hour</time>
               
               <date instant="false">several weeks before the murder</date>, armed with a
               
               <objectName instant="false" full="yes">revolver</objectName>. She did not, shortly before the murder,
               purchase a <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="gun">gun</span> and practice with it. "I know that
               some of these things, with many vicious details added, had been whispered around,"
               Mrs. Shelby said. "How most of them originated, no one knows. Some, I'm sure, were
               spread by a person formerly in my employ. I know that person and I know the motive.
               At the proper time and place I shall make known this motive, but in the meantime I
               am
               interested in just this: "I want to find out who circulates these rumors. I want to
               get definite information of definite statements against me, and then I am going to
               take definite action to the limit of my ability and the law." Mrs. Shelby's
               <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="bodyPart">blue eyes</span> lost some of their softness as
               she spoke. Only a <time instant="false">few minutes before</time> she came into the room to greet
               
               <persName instant="false" full="yes">the visitor</persName>. Attired in a soft, clinging <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="clothes">Viennese gown</span> of golden brown, with brown suede shoes
               to match, she sat near the window of her <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="residence">charming
                  apartment</span> in a court that looked like a corner of some far-away nook
               in old Granada. Outside Christmas crowds and <span xmlns="" class="entity objectName" data-hover="vehicle">laden
                  automobiles</span> moved back and forth. <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="mshelby">Margaret
                  Shelby Fillmore</span>, always a close pal and companion of her mother, sat
               nearby. </p>
            
            
            <p part="N"> The two had but recently returned from <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="continent">Europe</span>. <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="country">France</span>, <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="country">Belgium</span>, <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="country">Germany</span>,

               museums and <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="city">Florence</span> -- and then all the crash and
               cruel reverberations of the old Taylor case. "We arrived in <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="state">California</span>
               
               <date instant="false">November 17</date>. For <time instant="false">more than three years</time> we lived in
               <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="continent">Europe</span>. You know, there are many things we
               do not discuss with the outside world. There are many sorrows one must always bear
               alone or with those who are very near and close. "My <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">daughter</span> and I (to Mary Miles Minter, Mrs. Shelby never alluded as "my
               daughter") traveled and saw everything that was beautiful in old <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="continent">Europe</span>, but now we are back -- and to all this."
               As<span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby"> Mrs. Shelby</span> talked, framed against the
               
               <objectName instant="false" full="yes">deep window</objectName> and the

               flashed before the 
               <persName instant="false" full="yes">interviewer</persName> another
               
               <eventName instant="false" full="yes">occasion</eventName>, <time instant="false">almost eight years ago</time>, when
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby"> Mrs. Shelby</span> was an actress in a drama in which
               <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">Mary Miles Minter</span> was playing the leading part.
               It was in the <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="house">artistic living room</span> of their
               <span xmlns="" class="entity placeName" data-hover="residence">home</span>, on North Hobart boulevard, in
               
               <date instant="false">February 1922</date>. <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor"> William Desmond
                  Taylor</span>, a man of mystery and romance, a leading figure in the motion

               <eventName type="murder" instant="false" full="yes">murdered in his home</eventName>
               
               <date instant="false">a few nights before</date>. One by one several beautiful women -- names known
               throughout the world -- were brought into the case. And <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">Mary
                  Miles Minter</span>, young, vivacious, and then at the <time instant="false">height of her
                  artistic career</time>, was one of these. Mary, her face like a Greek profile of
               exquisite marble, sat on a couch and told of her last visit with Taylor -- in the
               darkened chamber of the undertaking parlors. She had gone there alone to place a
               beautiful dark red rose on the body of the man who was her director, friend, ideal.
               And Mrs. Shelby, close by, listened to the story and watched over Mary.</p>
            
            
            
            <p part="N"> But <time instant="false">yesterday</time>, as the brilliant 
               <date instant="false">Christmas afternoon</date> was
               changing into <time instant="false">evening</time>, it was a different story. "Yes, I remember that
               night, <time instant="false">nearly eight years ago</time>," Mrs. Shelby replied, and paused. "I want
               to forget it. Of <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="minter">Mary</span> I shall have nothing to say.
               She is in good hands and can take care of herself, I'm sure. "In those days my whole
               life was wrapped up in her. It was my work. Now I must fight for vindication. I've
               had enough of this, and I am going to ask that they put an end to the case once and
               for all." Throughout the entire discussion <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="cshelby">Mrs.
                  Shelby</span> was careful not to express any opinion on who killed <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">Taylor</span>. "<span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="taylor">Mr. Taylor</span> is
               dead. My daughter <span xmlns="" class="entity persName" data-hover="mshelby">Margaret</span> and I are still alive.
               We must be protected and not crushed by this gossip. "That's why," she continued,
               "the truth must be revealed, the truth must be spoken, the truth must be printed.</p>
            
            
            <p part="N">"Of course I have heard the dastardly whisperings about me and my connection with
