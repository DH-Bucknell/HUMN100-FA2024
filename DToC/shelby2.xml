               <byline>Edited by Katrina von Behren</byline>
               <byline>Reporter: A. M. Rochlen LOS ANGELES EXAMINER</byline>

               <p>In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the LOS ANGELES EXAMINER,
                     <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="familial">Mrs. Charlotte
                     Shelby</persName>, mother of <persName key="minter" ref="#actor">Mary Miles
                     Minter</persName>, last night for the first time revealed hitherto unknown
                  phases of <eventName type="murder">the <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                        >William Desmond Taylor</persName> murder case</eventName>. From the wealth
                  of memories so closely associated with the career of <persName key="minter"
                     ref="#actor" role="romantic">her talented daughter</persName> she brought forth
                  details that shed a new light on the many investigations that sought to unravel
                  the tangled threads of the <eventName type="murder">murder of the film
                     director</eventName> -- a case famous the world over. "The time for action has
                  come. I'm not going to sit idly and be a target for base rumors and vicious
                  innuendo. there must be some justice in this world -- even for a helpless woman."
                  Breaking a silence of more than seven eventful years, <persName key="cshelby"
                     ref="#family" role="familial">Mrs. Shelby</persName>, one of the dramatic and
                  ever-interesting figures of <eventName type="murder">the Taylor case</eventName>,
                  thus struck back at the endless chain of "whispers and theories" linking her, as
                  well as others, in the events of that <eventName type="murder">baffling
                     mystery</eventName>. Of <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic"
                     >Mary Miles Minter</persName>, who was a film star under <persName key="taylor"
                     ref="#director">Taylor</persName>'s direction, she had little to say. </p>

               <p>What here is disclosed would remain forever in her own <objectName type="bodyPart"
                     >heart</objectName>, she said, were it not for the rumors, reports and
                  insinuations that are making her life a dreadful dream. Desiring only to be left
                     alone,<persName key="cshelby" ref="#family"> Mrs. Shelby</persName> now feels
                  that she must cut through the web of whispers and suspicions to bring to an end
                  the repetitions of her name in connection with the <eventName type="murder"
                     >case</eventName>. And she wants to serve notice that every recourse of law
                  will be brought to bear to stop unwarranted bantering of her name and to force
                  those who have used it to come out in the open. "I have made complete statements
                  to the <persName key="police" ref="#law_enforcement">proper authorities</persName>
                  in the past and I stand ready to do it again if it will help in a sincere and
                  honest effort to solve <eventName type="murder">the mystery</eventName> of
                     <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor's</persName> death,"
                     <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="familial">Mrs. Shelby</persName>
                  said in the <eventName>interview</eventName>. "But somewhere, somehow, this thing
                  has got to stop. I demand it. We cannot go through life like this -- I and my
                     <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic">daughter</persName>,
                     <persName key="mshelby" ref="#family" role="familial">Margaret</persName>. We
                  are not hiding from anyone one anything. All we ask is to be left alone, and
                  somebody has got to help us fight this terrible thing." For the purpose of an
                  earnest and legitimate investigation, <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family"
                     role="familial">Mrs. Shelby</persName> revealed for the first time to THE
                  EXAMINER <time>last night</time> that -- She was not in love with <persName
                     key="taylor" ref="#director">William Desmond Taylor</persName>. She did not
                  make threats against the <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">famous
                     director</persName>.</p>


               <p>She did not go to <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName>'s
                     <placeName type="residence">bungalow</placeName> at <placeName type="address"
                     >404B South Alvarado Street</placeName> at an <time>early morning hour</time>
                  <date>several weeks before the murder</date>, armed with a
                     <objectName>revolver</objectName>. She did not, shortly before the murder,
                  purchase a <objectName type="gun">gun</objectName> and practice with it. "I know
                  that some of these things, with many vicious details added, had been whispered
                  around," Mrs. Shelby said. "How most of them originated, no one knows. Some, I'm
                  sure, were spread by a person formerly in my employ. I know that person and I know
                  the motive. At the proper time and place I shall make known this motive, but in
                  the meantime I am interested in just this: "I want to find out who circulates
                  these rumors. I want to get definite information of definite statements against
                  me, and then I am going to take definite action to the limit of my ability and the
                  law." Mrs. Shelby's <objectName type="bodyPart">blue eyes</objectName> lost some
                  of their softness as she spoke. Only a <time>few minutes before</time> she came
                  into the room to greet the visitor. Attired in a soft, clinging <objectName
                     type="clothes">Viennese gown</objectName> of golden brown, with brown suede
                  shoes to match, she sat near the window of her <placeName type="residence"
                     >charming apartment</placeName> in a court that looked like a corner of some
                  far-away nook in old Granada. Outside Christmas crowds and <objectName
                     type="vehicle">laden automobiles</objectName> moved back and forth. <persName
                     key="mshelby" ref="#family" role="familial">Margaret Shelby
                  Fillmore</persName>, always a close pal and companion of her mother, sat nearby. </p>

                  reverberations of the old Taylor case. "We arrived in <placeName type="state"
                     subtype="california">California</placeName>
                  <date>November 17</date>. For <time>more than three years</time> we lived in

                  there are many things we do not discuss with the outside world. There are many
                  sorrows one must always bear alone or with those who are very near and close. "My
                     <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic">daughter</persName> and I
                  (to Mary Miles Minter, Mrs. Shelby never alluded as "my daughter") traveled and

                     As<persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="familial"> Mrs. Shelby</persName>
                  talked, framed against the <objectName>deep window</objectName> and the

                     type="landscape">courtyard</placeName>, there flashed before the <persName
                     key="reporter" ref="#professional" role="business">interviewer</persName>
                  another <eventName>occasion</eventName>, <time>almost eight years ago</time>, when
                     <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="familial"> Mrs. Shelby</persName>
                  was an actress in a drama in which <persName key="minter" ref="#actor"
                     role="romantic">Mary Miles Minter</persName> was playing the leading part. It
                  was in the <placeName type="house">artistic living room</placeName> of their
                     <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>, on North Hobart boulevard, in
                     <date>February 1922</date>. <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"> William
                     Desmond Taylor</persName>, a man of mystery and romance, a leading figure in
                  the motion picture world, was <eventName type="murder">murdered in his
                     home</eventName>
                  <date>a few nights before</date>. One by one several beautiful women -- names
                  known throughout the world -- were brought into the case. And <persName
                     key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic">Mary Miles Minter</persName>, young,
                  vivacious, and then at the <time>height of her artistic career</time>, was one of
                  these. Mary, her face like a Greek profile of exquisite marble, sat on a couch and
                  told of her last visit with Taylor -- in the darkened chamber of the undertaking
                  parlors. She had gone there alone to place a beautiful dark red rose on the body
                  of the man who was her director, friend, ideal. And Mrs. Shelby, close by,
                  listened to the story and watched over Mary.</p>


               <p> But <time>yesterday</time>, as the brilliant <date>Christmas afternoon</date> was
                  changing into <time>evening</time>, it was a different story. "Yes, I remember
                  that night, <time>nearly eight years ago</time>," Mrs. Shelby replied, and paused.
                  "I want to forget it. Of <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic"
                     >Mary</persName> I shall have nothing to say. She is in good hands and can take
                  care of herself, I'm sure. "In those days my whole life was wrapped up in her. It
                  was my work. Now I must fight for vindication. I've had enough of this, and I am
                  going to ask that they put an end to the case once and for all." Throughout the
                  entire discussion <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="familial">Mrs.
                     Shelby</persName> was cakeyul not to express any opinion on who killed
                     <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName>. "<persName
                     key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> is dead. My daughter

                  are still alive. We must be protected and not crushed by this gossip. "That's
                  why," she continued, "the truth must be revealed, the truth must be spoken, the
                  truth must be printed.</p>

               <p>"Of course I have heard the dastardly whisperings about me and my connection with
                  the case. I have heard them all -- that I was in love with Mr. Taylor, that I
                  owned a <objectName type="gun">gun</objectName> and used to practice on a target a
                  short time before the murder, that I went to Mr. Taylor's <placeName
                     type="residence">apartment</placeName> early <time>one morning</time> searching
                  for Mr. Taylor and threatening him with death, that I had made many other threats,
                  and so on and on. </p>

               <p>"Each and every one of these rumors and whisperings is ridiculous". </p>

               <p>Let us take them one by one and see," she declared.</p>

               <p>"I did have a <objectName>gun</objectName>."</p>

               <p>"It was given to me by a jeweler friend of ours in <placeName type="city"
                     subtype="santaBarbara">Santa Barbara</placeName>, way back in
                  <date>1916</date>. That was a long time before<persName key="taylor"
                     ref="#director"> Mr. Taylor</persName> was killed.</p>

               <p>"We were living in <placeName type="city" subtype="santaBarbara">Santa
                     Barbara</placeName>. I was <persName key="minter" ref="#actor"
                  >Mary</persName>'s business manager. I had to read the stories for her <objectName
                     type="possession">pictures</objectName>, work on the scenarios, watch over her
                     <objectName type="clothes">clothes</objectName>, the cast, everything.</p>

               <p>"We lived alone. No men folks in the <placeName type="residence"
                     >household</placeName>. Our friend brought the <objectName>gun</objectName> to
                  the <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> one night. He said I must keep
                  it.</p>

               <p> "'But I don't know how to use it. I never held one in my hand before,' I told
                  him. </p>
               <p>"'Well, let's learn,' he replied."</p>

               <p><persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="familial">Mrs. Shelby</persName>
                  smiled.</p>

               <p>"You know, this really bears a strange element of humor, now that I look back on
                  it.</p>

               <p> "We went out to some open spaces and I took this <objectName>gun</objectName> in
                  my right hand. It was a pretty little thing -- had a pearl handle and all that. I
                  pointed the <objectName type="gun">gun</objectName> at something or other, shut my
                  eyes and pulled hard. The thing went 'boom' and threw my arm back.</p>

               <p> "I did that several times in succession. That was all."</p>

               <p>"Still, they call it target practice."</p>

               <p>Mrs. Shelby said she did not remember what had become of the
                     <objectName>gun</objectName>. She says she has no recollection of bringing it
                  back to <placeName type="city" subtype="losAngeles">Los Angeles</placeName> when
                  the household moved from <placeName type="city" subtype="santaBarbara">Santa

               <p> "That much for target practicing," she declared.</p>

               <p>"Now about that visit to <placeName>Mr. Taylor's house</placeName>.</p>

               <p>"To understand it, I must take you <time>back a few years</time>. I must ask you

                  had been in New York. I negotiated new contracts. There were trips and conferences

                  they relate to the contacts made with a former employee for whom I sent to

                  figured in the visit story.</p>

               <p>"We were back in <placeName type="state" subtype="california"

                  of picture <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic">Mary</persName> was

                  was a big, fast roadster, and <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic"
                     >Mary</persName> liked speed. She used to go out, tearing along the roads at 60
                  and 70 miles an hour. I was her mother and it worried me -- naturally.</p>

               <p>"We were living on <placeName type="residence">Fremont place</placeName>. At

               <p> Earlier in the interview some allusion was made to <persName key="minter"
                     ref="#actor" role="business">Mary Miles Minter's</persName> glowing account of
                  the slain director and to the love letters and tokens, most of them unidentified,

               <p> "I'm sure, <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> was a

                     Shelby</persName> said. </p>
               <p> She hesitated a little, and then went on. </p>
               <p> "I'm going to rip all this innuendo wide open -- there is no other way," she went
                  on. </p>
               <p> "I know that there have been reports that I was in love with <persName
                     key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> and that I was jealous of my
                  daughter and also feared that <persName key="minter" ref="#family" role="business"

               <p> "I am repeating these things just to show the absurdity of them. How is it
                  possible to have such a double motive? The mere repetition of it shows the
                  absurdity of the whole thing. Killing <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr.
                     Taylor </persName>would have wrecked <persName key="minter" ref="#actor"

               <p> "But aside from that, the whole thing is ridiculous -- and vicious. </p>

               <p> "I was not in love with <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">William Desmond
                     Taylor</persName>. I was not in love with anyone. And no one was in love with

                     ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> in my life. He was always aloof, a man of
                  mystery, polished, distant and reserved. </p>
               <p> "In <time>those days</time> my tasks and interests were few. I lived, talked,
                  planned and worked only for <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business"
                     >Mary</persName> and her pictures. </p>
               <p> "How utterly ridiculous, how unjust and criminal, to cast accusations of such
                  flimsy nature, merely on 'clues' of such thin stuff. A crime without a motive, or
                  reason." </p>

                  keyerences to <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> were most
                  impersonal. In fact, she said during the interview, <persName key="taylor"
                     ref="#director">Taylor</persName> himself was impersonal. </p>
               <p> She came back to the <date>night of February 1, 1922</date>, when <persName
