            <p> WHITNEY: ** and <persName type="minter" ref="#actor">Mary</persName> stood up and looked at her <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">mother</persName> and
               said, "Do you really mean that?"" and <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Mrs. Shelby</persName> said, "I certainly do." She accused
               her of being intimate with <persName type="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> and then made other remarks. ** <persName type="minter" ref="#actor">She</persName> locked herself
               in her <placeName type="house">mother's room</placeName> ** and she got the <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName> and
               <eventName key="suicide">tried to kill herself</eventName>, but there was a safety catch on it
               and it wouldn't go off. ** <persName key="minter" ref="#actor">Mary</persName> was monkeying with this thing and finally the catch
               released itself and the darn <eventName key="suicide">gun went off</eventName>. **</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: What kind of a <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName> was that?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: <objectName key="gun">Revolver</objectName>. A little snub-nosed thing.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Was it a black one?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: Yes.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Who did the <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName> belong to?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Mrs. Shelby</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Do you know how long <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">she</persName> had it?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: Oh, <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">she</persName> always carried a <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName>. I mean we always kept one in the
               <placeName type="redsidence">house</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">She</persName> knew how to handle a <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p>A Oh, <persName type="whitney" ref="#servant">I</persName> should say so.</p>
            
            <p>A ** <time key="date">one night</time> when we (witness and Mrs. Shelby) went down to <persName type="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor's</persName>
               after <persName type="minter" ref="#actor">Mary</persName>,<persName type="shelby" ref="#family"> Mrs. Shelby</persName> took the <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName>, but I don't think she had any intention of
               using it on Mary.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">she (Shelby)</persName>
               <eventName key="threat">threaten to kill</eventName>
               <persName type="taylor" ref="#director">him (Taylor)</persName>?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: Yes. Several people heard that. It was in my
               <placeName type="office">office</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: When was it in your <placeName type="office">office</placeName>?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: That was in <date key="date">1920, in the summer</date>. <persName type="taylor" ref="#director">He</persName>
               (Taylor) had finished directing with <persName type="minter" ref="#actor">Mary</persName>. <persName type="maigne" ref="#director">Charley
                  Maigne</persName> was directing <persName type="minter" ref="#actor">her</persName> and <persName type="maigne" ref="#director">Charley</persName> was in the <placeName type="office">office</placeName>, and <persName type="Taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> was
               in the <placeName type="office">office</placeName>. **</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: ** <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">She</persName> said, "If <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">I</persName> ever catch you hanging around
               <persName type="minter" ref="#actor">Mary</persName> again, <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">I</persName> will blow your god damned
               <objectName key="bodyPart">brains</objectName> out." She walked right up to him. She was just
               livid with rage and shook her <objectName key="bodyPart">fist</objectName> in his
               <objectName key="bodyPart">face</objectName> and swore dozens of times.</p>
            
            
            <p>POLICE: Do you know of an incident that occurred in which <persName type="blue" ref="#actor">Monte
               Blue</persName> was supposed to have been run out of the <placeName type="studio">dressing
                  room</placeName> with a <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName> by <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Mrs.
                     Shelby</persName>?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: Well, <persName type="whitney" ref="#servant">I</persName> don't know that she had a <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName>, but I know
               that he was run out of the <placeName type="studio">dressing room</placeName>, because he ran into
               <placeName type="office">my office</placeName> from the <placeName type="studio">dressing
                  room</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>(keyerring to incidents surrounding visit of<persName type="shelby" ref="#family"> Mrs. Shelby</persName> to Taylor's residence in
               search of Mary) ** <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">She (Mrs. Shelby)</persName> said, "I will take my
               <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName>, and if I find her there <eventName key="threat">I am going to kill her.</eventName>" I
               begged her not to take it ** She wouldn't do it, so she went with the
               <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName>. **</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: She had the <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName> with her at that time?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">She</persName> had it in her hand and her <objectName key="clothing">coat
               sleeve</objectName>; she had <objectName key="clothing">big coat sleeves</objectName> and the
               <objectName key="clothing">gun</objectName> was in her hand hid by her coat sleeve.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Do you know of any other trouble with <persName type="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> that
               <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Mrs. Shelby</persName> had?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: They fought all the time. Always on the <placeName type="studio">set</placeName> when <persName type="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName>
               was directing.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Was the situation getting <time key="mad">worse a11 the time</time>?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: <time key="mad">A11 the time</time>. It was terrible.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Was there anyone else present at any of these <eventName key="fights">battles</eventName>,
               that you recall, over <persName type="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName>?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: Well, <persName type="stockdale">Earl Stockdale</persName>. <persName type="whitney" ref="#servant">I</persName> am sure <persName type="stockdale">he</persName> was present.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Do you know any of <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">her</persName> servants (Shelby's) at the time of the murder?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: I knew them only by their first names. ** We had a butler named
               <persName type="frederick" ref="#servant">Frederick</persName>, a butler named ¬≠<persName type="ernest" ref="#servant">Ernest</persName>, and
               a cook named <persName type="pauline" ref="#servant">Pauline</persName>. <persName type="stewart" ref="#servant">Edith Stewart</persName> was
               Mary's personal maid at that time</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Can <persName type="whitney" ref="#servant">you</persName> think of any friends of yours, or any acquaintances of <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName>, in any
               way at all, that were associating with or closely associated with them immediately
               prior to, or immediately after, Taylor's murder?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: <persName type="periolet" ref="#actor">M. George Periolet</persName>. is at <placeName type="redsidence">Engstrom
               Apartments, Los Angeles</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: ** Have you talked to <persName type="mcpherson" ref="#actor">Jeanne McPherson</persName> at all?</p>
            
            <p> WHITNEY: <persName type="mcpherson" ref="#actor">Jeanne</persName> knows a great, big, large lot. Jeanne came over
               to see <persName type="minter" ref="#actor">Mary</persName> <time key="date">a day or so after the murder</time>. She would be a good person for
               you to talk to. And her mother, <persName type="o'neil" ref="#family">Mrs. O'Neil</persName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Well, going back to that old subject of the gun, I just wanted to be sure
               that <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Mrs. Shelby</persName> had it in the <placeName type="redsidence">house</placeName> for a <time key="duration">long
                  time</time>.</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: Oh yes, there was always a <objectName key="gun">gun</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: If anybody said that <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Mrs. She1by</persName> did not know anything about a <objectName key="gun">pistol</objectName> or
               revolver, and was afraid of one, that would not be true?</p>
            
            <p>WHITNEY: That's ridiculous. <persName type="shelby" ref="#family">Mrs. Shelby</persName> was not afraid of anything.</p>
