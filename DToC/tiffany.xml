               be given to understand he wasn't there, and she would get in her <objectName type="vechile">car</objectName> and come over,
               and find him there. I have seen her coming out of the <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> as if she were about

            <p> POLICE: Did she speak to him? </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: No; she said he turned and looked right at the <objectName type="vechile">street car</objectName>, and looked right
               at her as if he didn't recognize her, and she said she had a notion to get off the

            <p> TIFFANY: She said he had on a <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>, a <objectName type="clothing">grey cap</objectName> and <objectName type="clothing">grey overcoat</objectName>, one of these what

            <p> POLICE: What was his nationality? </p>
