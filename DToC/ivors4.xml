            <byline>Edited by Olivia King</byline>
            <p> October 3, 1922 HONOLULU STAR-BULLETIN A dramatic love story with all the gripping
               beauty of the <placeName type="set">Hawaiian islands</placeName> as a background is
               what <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>, scenario writer and
               director for the <orgName type="production">Lasky corporation</orgName>, has come to
               <placeName type="set">Honolulu </placeName>to film.</p>
            <p> The beaches, mountains, gardens and palm trees of <placeName type="set">Oahu
            </placeName>and <placeName type="state">Hawaii</placeName> are to provide the setting
               for the story, which <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Mrs. Ivers</persName> says could be
               produced nowhere else in the world. "I wrote the scenario here," she told a
               representative of the Star-Bulletin at <placeName type="set"> the Moana</placeName>
               today, "and this is the only spot in the universe where it can be filmed as it should
               be. It is imbued with the breath of <placeName type="set">the islands</placeName>.
               When I returned to <placeName type="city">Los Angeles </placeName>after my visit here
               last spring, at which time I gathered material for the scenario, <persName
                  key="lasky" ref="#writer">Mr. Lasky</persName> asked me if the <objectName type="possession"
                     >picture</objectName> could not be produced on <placeName type="set">the
                        mainland</placeName>. 'I'll read you the story,' I replied, and I did. He had
               nothing more to say, and here we are ready to work.</p>
            <p>While the <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName> was not planned with the
               specific idea of giving publicity to <placeName type="set">the islands</placeName>,
               it still will be of tremendous benefit in portraying to mainland people the marvels
               of this section of the globe. It will be a true mirror in which those of the outer
               world may see life as it is lived in the Paradise of the Pacific.</p>
            <p> "I wrote the story," <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Mrs. Ivers</persName> said, "with a
               genuine love and affection for the islands, and I will produce it in the same way. No
               'roughneck' of a director will have a chance to squeeze the fragrance out of the
               plot, for I am going to direct the action myself. It is some time since I did that
               sort of work, but I have chosen my cast and staff myself. I know something of the
               atmosphere of <placeName type="state">Hawaii</placeName> and I wrote the story
               myself. I am just sure that if we can get things into film as we see them here the
               island will owe us a very great deal of gratitude.</p>
            <p> "One scene will be taken showing the departure of a steamer and including that
               lovable custom of giving leis, which is to me most touching. When I left <placeName
                  type="setting">Honolulu</placeName> last spring returning to <placeName
                     type="city">Los Angeles</placeName> I cried as the boat pulled away from the dock.
               I was not leaving a host of friends either, but there is something about the strains
               of 'Aloha Oe' which brings the moisture to the eyes and a catch to the throat. This
               atmosphere is what we hope to catch in our <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName>, and we hope that when it comes back to <placeName
                     type="set">Honolulu </placeName>as a finished product the people will think that
               we have done full justice to our theme."</p>
            <p>
               <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Mrs. Ivers</persName> is a pioneer in the moving <objectName
                  type="possession">picture</objectName> profession, having been identified with it
               in every sort of a capacity for the last nine years. She knows the game from A to Z.
               "I will have no one to blame if I fail to get a good <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName>," she says. "<persName key="lasky" ref="#writer">Mr. Lasky</persName>
               permitted me to select my own cast and to choose my technical force, camera man, art
               director and all. I am in full charge and I have every confidence in my company.
               There is not a person in it who will not go the limit to do as he or she is told. I
               know they will all give their very best to make the <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName> a success."</p>
            <p>
               <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Mrs. Ivers</persName> believes she is especially fortunate in
               her choice of her art director, George Hopkins<persName/>. "He is really very
               superior," she said, "and has done some wonderful work on interiors. He has a weird
               touch which makes his work stand out."</p>
            <p> While a number of locations have been chosen, <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Mrs.
               Ivers</persName> said that they may not be used. "You see," she said, "the art
               director, the camera man, and electrician always inspect a location before we begin
               to 'shoot.' If any one of them has a fault to find I simply give up the location and
               seek something else that will be suitable. The art director and <objectName
                  type="film">the camera</objectName> man have to produce the artistic part of
               <objectName type="film">the film </objectName>. I have my company in the center of
               the location and I am often called upon to move the actors to one side or another in
               order that <objectName type="film">the camera</objectName> may register striking
               features that may be at one side or the other of those of the cast. It would never do
               to have <objectName type="film">the film </objectName>unbalanced."</p>
            <p>The very newest in motion <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName>
               <objectName type="film">cameras</objectName>s will be used by the company here.
               <objectName type="film">The "Mitchell,"</objectName> a machine which combines all
               of the good points of all other <objectName type="film">cameras</objectName> with
               none of their bad points, is included in the equipment brought from <placeName
                  type="set">the mainland</placeName>. There also are <objectName type="film">two
                     other older style cameras</objectName> to be used.</p>
            <p>It is possible that work of filming may start before Friday, <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer"
