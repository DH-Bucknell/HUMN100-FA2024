               <byline>Edited by Liv King</byline>
               <p>
                  <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Julia Crawford Ivers</persName> was closely associated with
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"> Taylor</persName> for over six years and wrote the
                  scenarios for most of his <orgName type="company">Paramount</orgName> films. After
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"> Taylor's </persName> murder, her career soon faded.</p>
               <p><persName key="minter" ref="#actor">When Mary Miles Minter</persName> was interrogated by Deputy
                  District Attorney William Doran<persName/>, on February 7, 1922, <persName

                        Ivers</persName>. But <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Ivers</persName> was never seriously
                  considered a suspect.</p>
               <p>Reticent and shy of personal publicity, she gave very few interviews throughout her
                  career. [17] The following are some isolated exceptions:</p>
               
               <p> October 16, 1920 Giebler MOVING PICTURE WORLD I had the pleasure of making the
                  acquaintance of <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>, of the
                  <placeName type="setting">scenario department</placeName>, a lady who occupies a
                  large and closely written page in the "Who's Who and Why, and What and When, and
                  Where, and How Come" of <placeName type="studio">Filmland</placeName>.</p>
               <p><persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Miss Ivers</persName> says she has done almost everything
                  around a <placeName type="setting">studio</placeName> but sweep <objectName
                     type="floor">the floor</objectName>. She was six years at the <placeName
                        type="studio">Morosco studio</placeName> before coming to the <placeName
                           type="company">Lasky plant</placeName>, where she held every position from film
                  cutter and editor to superintendent of the plant. [<persName key="ivers" ref="#writer"
                     >Ivers</persName> also directed several films.] <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Miss
                        Ivers</persName> has a large number of original stories and adaptations to her
                  credit, including Tom Sawyer, Huck and Tom, The Furnace, The Soul of Youth, two
                  stories as yet unnamed to be produced by <persName key="minter" ref="#actor">Mary Miles
                     Minter</persName>, and The Witching Hour, now being made by <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                        >William D. Taylor</persName>; and in addition to this, she has published
                  <objectName type="document">stories and articles </objectName>in many of the
                  leading <objectName type="document">magazines</objectName>. She is a person of
                  decided opinions as to the writer and his relation to the finished film.</p>
               <p> "The writer is only a helper," she says, "and sometimes very poor help. More stories
                  have been spoiled than made by writers who tried to put them in <objectName
                     type="possession">picture</objectName> form, and if many of the writers who are
                  yelping for credit on the screen should be debited with the lack of imagination and
                  lack of vision they display, they would have no more to say."</p>
