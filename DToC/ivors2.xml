            <head>Newspaper Interview With Julia C. Ivers</head>
            <byline>Edited by Liv King</byline>
            <p> February 7, 1922 LOS ANGELES EXAMINER <persName key="ivers" ref="#writer">Julia Crawford
               Ivers</persName>, scenarist for the late <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">William D.
                  Taylor</persName>, yesterday gave out the following statement:</p>
            <p> "Today the friends of <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">William D. Taylor</persName>, and they
               are legion, will gather to pay the last tribute to the man they love, to one who as
               man, director and friend measured 100 per cent. </p>
            <p> "I have worked side by side with this man for seven years. We have solved many
               difficult problems together, sometimes pleasant, sometimes unpleasant: always hard,
               trying nerve-wracking. And during all these years of close association I have never
               known him to do one unkind, one ungenerous act, but I have known hundreds of
               instances of open-handed generosity and in most cases the beneficiary never knew whom
               to thank.</p>
            <p>"This man whose loyalty and honor were without question, who takes with him the
               undying gratitude of the thousands to whom he has lent a helping hand--this man who
               stood for everything that was fine and clean in <objectName type="possession"
                  >picture</objectName>, who is known to have declared that if it were necessary to
               his success to produce unclean <objectName type="possession">picture</objectName> he
               would go back to the white, clean snows of <placeName type="state">Alaska</placeName>
               and dig his living out of the ground--this man was shot in the back by a cowardly
               assassin. He was given no opportunity to defend himself and <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                  >William D. Taylor</persName> would have defended himself, for he did not know the
               meaning of the word fear. And more cowardly than the <objectName type="gun"
                  >assassin's bullet</objectName>, lodged in<objectName type="bodyPart"> the
                     heart</objectName> of this dear man, is the tongue of scandal, which safely
               sheltered behind his <objectName type="body">dead body</objectName>, is striking at
               his reputation--more cowardly for he is powerless to defend himself.</p>
            <p>"His friends know that when it is all over the character of <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
               >Mr. Taylor</persName> will stand, as it always has stood, for everything that is
               fine and worth while.</p>
            <p>"<objectName type="possession">The good book</objectName> says, 'Let him who is
               without sin cast the first stone.' And it is recorded that no stones were cast."</p>
