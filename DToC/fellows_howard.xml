            <p>POLICE: Where did you take<persName key="taylor" ref="#director"> Mr. Taylor</persName> the day he was <eventName type="killed">killed</eventName>
               begin in the morning?</p>
            
            <p> FELLOWS: It was the <placeName key="studio">studio</placeName>. ...called for him I think at <time type="estimation">one o'clock.</time> I took him
               down town to the <placeName type="bank">bank</placeName>, which I drove <persName key="harryFellows" ref="#director">Harry</persName> up to see you, I
               think it was, which I went home and called for him at <time type="afternoon">quarter of four</time> at
               <placeName type="store">Robinson's</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p> POLICE: <placeName type="store">Robinson's Store</placeName>? </p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: Yes. He came along â€š<persName key="harryFellows" ref="director">Harry</persName> was waiting to see him.
               They talked there until it was pretty near time for me to move or get a ticket for
               standing after hours. (After relating taking <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> home,
               he, <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> said) "I will call you between <time type="nighttime">7 and 7:30
               </time>if I want you.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: You went around to<persName key="taylor" ref="#director"> Mr. Taylor's</persName>
               <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> the night he was <eventName type="killed">killed</eventName>.</p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: Yes.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Just describe your movements when you went there giving the time?</p>
            
            <p> FELLOWS: I called up at the <placeName>house </placeName>at <time>5 minutes after
               8</time> which I looked at my <objectName type="jewelry">watch</objectName> * * I called up and got no answer. About
               <time type="morning">5 minutes after 8</time> I tried to call and I went out and got into the
               <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>, drove up 6th to <placeName type="alvarado">Alvarado</placeName>, up
               <placeName>Alvarado</placeName> to <placeName type="street">Maryland</placeName> and right
               around in back there where his <objectName type="passage">garage</objectName> is, right behind the <placeName type="residence">landlord's
                  house</placeName> * * * I didn't put the <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> away then, I left the <objectName type="vehicle">engine</objectName> running
               and lights on.** I rang the <objectName type="doorbell">door bell</objectName>, the lights were all lit which I thought he
               might be <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> on account of all the lights being lit. I rang
               the <objectName type="doorbell">door bell </objectName>and the second time I rang the <objectName type="doorbell">door bell</objectName> I looked at my <objectName type="jewelry">watch</objectName> ***,
               which my watch says <time>quarter after 8</time>. I rung the <objectName type="doorbell">door bell</objectName> 4 or 5 times
               because I kind of thought he was in there on account of thoughts being lit.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Could you hear the<objectName type="doorbell"> door bell</objectName> ringing?</p>
            
            <p> FELLOWS: Yes. I started away and I got about to the steps and I hesitated to see if
               I could hear him coming. As I hesitated there was no sound and I went and put the <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>
               away, opened the <objectName type="passage">garage doors</objectName> and put the <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> away, closed the <objectName type="house">door</objectName> and walked right
               straight through the court down <placeName type="alvarado">Alvarado</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p> POLICE: You did not open the <objectName type="passage">screen door</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: No, never do open any <objectName type="door">door</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Did you ever have such occasion before, the lights would be on and he would
               not answer the <objectName type="doorbell">door bell</objectName>?</p>
            
            <p> FELLOWS: I never had any occasions like that. *** as I go around I notice there is a
               light lit in his <placeName type="residence">bedroom</placeName> and a light lit in his
               <placeName type="residence">den</placeName>. There is always them lights but it was a dim light.
               This time all the lights were lit, <placeName type="house">dining room</placeName> lights were lit and they lit up the
               certains that much more.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: His <placeName type="location">upstairs</placeName> lights were lit?</p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: One of them, just a glance I took at them.</p></div>
