            <p>NANCE: In what part of the <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> were they?</p>

            <p>NANCE: Did you carry <objectName type="posession">the back door key</objectName> with you?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No, sir. I always turn it in the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName> and leave it

            <p>PEAVEY: Nothing more than a <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName> that was sitting next to the wall had been pushed
               out a little bit and <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">his</persName> <objectName type="bodyPart">feet</objectName> was under this <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName>. The rest of the <objectName type="furniture">furniture</objectName> around
               the <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> and <placeName type="house">room upstairs</placeName> was just as I left them when I went away that
               evening.</p>

            <p>NANCE: And did you notice whether anything had been taken off of <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">his</persName> <objectName type="bodyPart">body</objectName>, or not -
               any <objectName type="posession">jewelry</objectName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: I didn't notice that; I didn't touch <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">him</persName> at all.</p>

            <p> NANCE: Do you know whether <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> wore any valuable <objectName type="posession">jewelry</objectName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> had a <objectName type="posession">wrist watch</objectName> and another<objectName type="posession"> watch</objectName> with a lot of little trinkets

            <p>NANCE: Did <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> have a <objectName type="posession">diamond ring</objectName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> had a large <objectName type="posession">diamond ring</objectName> that <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> wore.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Do you know whether <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> had it on that <time>evening</time>?,</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: Yes sir, <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> was dressed just as when I went <time>that evening</time>, as I found <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">him</persName> the
               next morning.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Was the <objectName type="posession">ring</objectName> on his <objectName type="bodyPart">finger</objectName> the <time>next morning</time>?</p>

            <p>NANCE: You didn't find anything taken from the <placeName type="residence">apartment</placeName>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No sir, it was just as when I left it when I found it. The <objectName type="furniture">rug</objectName> was a little
               bit kicked up. It looked like he had kicked it with his foot.</p>

            <p>NANCE: There was no other disturbance there?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No, sir. Even the <placeName type="house">living-room</placeName> <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> that I had moved aside. The <objectName type="furniture">rocking chair</objectName>
               would hit the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName>, and I moved the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> so the <objectName type="furniture">rocking chair</objectName> would not hit the
               <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName>. It was just as I left it.</p>

            <p>NANCE: By a juror: Were any of the <objectName type="decoration">windows</objectName> up at night?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No sir, we had those little long <objectName type="decoration">pins</objectName> that runs in the <objectName type="passage">windows</objectName>. The <objectName type="passage">windows</objectName>
               <placeName type="wing">upstairs</placeName> in <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">his</persName> <placeName type="house">bedroom</placeName> were up. The <objectName type="passage">windows</objectName> downstairs I always locked with this peg
               that slipped in the <objectName type="passage">window</objectName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Were they still that way in the <time>morning</time>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: They were still that way in the <time>morning</time>. The <objectName type="lighting">lights</objectName> were burning just as I
               had left them <time>that night</time>; <objectName type="lighting">two lights</objectName>, one in the <placeName type="house">living-room</placeName> and one in the
               <placeName type="house">dining-room</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE:That is all, you may be excused.</p>

            <p>I hereby certify that I, as shorthand reporter, correctly took down in shorthand the
               testimony and proceedings had at the within named Coroner's inquest; that the
               foregoing is a full, true and correct copy of my shorthand notes and a full, true and
               correct statement of the testimony and pro- ceedings had at said inquest. E.M. Allen,
               Shorthand Reporter</p>
