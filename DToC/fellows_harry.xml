            <p> POLICE: Did she appear to be fond of him?</p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: <persName key="minter" ref="#actor">Miss Minter</persName>?</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Yes.</p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: Yes, she did seem to be very fond of <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName>. - - -
               and seemed to chase him around to the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName> and things like that. As far as I
               know<persName key="taylor" ref="#director"> Mr. Taylor</persName> never really thought an awful lot of
               <persName key="minter" ref="#actor">Miss Minter</persName>. I mean more than just to like her for a nice
               little girl. He thought more of <persName key="normand" ref="#actor">Miss Normand</persName> than he did of any
               one I have ever known. I got there I must have got at <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName>â€š <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> about <time type="morning">8 o'clock in the morning</time> when I
               came there.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: That is the day he was killed?</p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: Yes, on <time key="morning">Thursday morning</time>.</p>
            
            <p> POLICE: Well, did you know that he was killed before you went there?</p>
            
            <p>FELLOWS: No, my brother called me up and told me<persName key="taylor" ref="#director"> Mr. Taylor</persName> was
               found dead. I understood him to say <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> was found <eventName type="dead ">dead</eventName> in
               <placeName type="residence">bed</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: Who was there, <persName key="harryFellows" ref="#director">Harry</persName>, when you came in?</p>
            
            <p> FELLOWS: There was <persName key="dougMaclean" ref="#actor">Douglas MacLean</persName> and the owner of the court I
               think, his name is <persName key="jessurun">Jesserun</persName>. I think there was two men from
               headquarters and my brother, <persName key="howardFellows" ref="#servant">Howard</persName> and<persName key="henrypeavey" ref="#servant"> Henry
                  Peavey</persName>. I am not positive whether the <persName key="doctor" ref="#professional">doctor</persName> was
               there when I first got there or whether he came when I was phoning <persName key="eyton" ref="#director">Mr.
                  Eyton</persName>. <persName key="hoyt" ref="#actor">Arthur Hoyt</persName> and <persName key="maigne" ref="director">Charlie
                     Maigne</persName> and myself went <placeName key="place">upstairs</placeName> and got all the
               literature and things like that that we could get and put them in a <objectName type="package">package</objectName> *** and I
               gave <persName key="jimmie">Jimmie Vantrees</persName> who was <persName key="cameraman" ref="#professional">Mr. Taylor's
                  Cameraman</persName> and<persName key="ivers" ref="#director"> Mrs. Ivers (Jimmie's mother)</persName> and ask
               them to keep the letters for me. Why <persName key="jimmie" ref="#actor">Jimmie</persName> must have given them
               to <persName key="ivers" ref="#director">Mrs. Ivers</persName> and then then I went right over and got them from
               her and took them out to the<placeName type="studio"> studio</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>POLICE: What did you do with them?</p>
            
            <p> FELLOWS: Gave them to<persName key="eyton" ref="#director"> Mr. Eyton</persName>. *** I dont think any body
               made an examination until <persName key="eyton" ref="director">Mr. Eyton</persName> insisted on an examination
               being made and that must have been <time type="estimation">two hours or 2 hours after</time> the time
               we got there anyway.</p></div>
