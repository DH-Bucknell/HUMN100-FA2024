            <byline>Daniel Hou</byline>

            <p><persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">James Kirkwood</persName>, <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">actor and motion-picture director</persName>, was
               <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary Miles Minter's</persName> <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">first director</persName> when she commenced making
               <objectName type="document">pictures</objectName> for <orgName type="production">the American Film Company</orgName> in <placeName type="Santa_Barbara">Santa
                  Barbara</placeName> in <time>1916</time>. <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">She</persName> was 15 years of age at the time.</p>

            <p><eventName type="love"><persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> then consummated the marriage in a much more mundane way as a result of
               which <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> became pregnant</eventName>. <eventName type="love">Intercourse went on for <time>a number of months</time></eventName>.</p>

            <p><persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> then left for <placeName type="city">New York</placeName> <time>(late 1916 or early in 1917)</time> and a
               clandestine correspondence commenced between the two. <eventName type="contaction"><persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> wrote a series of
                  <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> to <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName></eventName>. These were sent to another male member of <orgName type="production">the motion-picture company</orgName>
               who delivered the missives to <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName>. The <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> were in <objectName type="document">plain white envelopes</objectName> labeled
               <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">“Juliet”</persName>. (Mary' s true name was Juliet Reilly.) In the meantime <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary's</persName> condition was
               causing <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">her mother</persName>, <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">Mrs. Charlotte Shelby</persName>, (<eventName type="murder">always a <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">suspect</persName> in the <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> murder</eventName>,)
               much concern. The <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">girl's</persName> weight continued to increase and <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">the mother</persName> tried <objectName type="food">all kinds
               of diets</objectName>.</p>
 
            <p><eventName type="conatction">The correspondence between <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> and <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> continued</eventName>, <eventName type="contaction">but <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">the mother</persName> at last
               intercepted <objectName type="document">one of the letters</objectName></eventName>. <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> at the time was staying at <placeName type="lambs_club">the Lamb's Club</placeName>
               in <placeName type="city">New York</placeName>. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">Mrs. Shelby</persName> tore up the ground, to use Kary1s words, when <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">she</persName> found out
               what was going on.</p>

            <p><eventName type="contaction"><persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> was forced to write a <objectName type="doument">letter</objectName> to <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> saying that they had been found out and
               that her mother insisted that their <eventName type="love">romance</eventName> end at once</eventName>. Also the mother insisted
               that <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> return <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> written to <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">him</persName> by <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName>. </p>

            <p><persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">The mother</persName> then took this <objectName type="document">collection of letters</objectName> and kept them in <objectName type="box">a safe-deposit box</objectName>.
               <eventName type="contaction"><objectName type="document">They</objectName> were given to <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> recently</eventName> when <eventName type="relationship"><persName key="mshelby" ref="#family" role="unknown">Mary's sister</persName>, <persName key="mshelby" ref="#family" role="unknown">Margaret Fillmore</persName>, had a falling
               out with <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">her mother</persName></eventName>. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">The mother</persName> supposedly kept these <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> to hold over Mary's
               head but <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> says that throughout the many rows between <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">her</persName> and <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">her mother</persName> since
               that the latter never mentioned the <objectName type="document">missives</objectName>.</p>
            
            <p><persName key="mshelby" ref="#family" role="unknown">Margaret</persName> says that her mother once declared she was keeping the <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> so if anyone
               ever <eventName type="murder">accused <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">her</persName> of murdering <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> that <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">she</persName> could prove that if <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">she</persName> was ever going
               to murder anyone <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">she</persName> would have murdered <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> at the time</eventName>.</p>
            
            <p>The assortment of <objectName>letters</objectName> from <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> contain little factual evidence and are
               mostly devoted to the outpouring of a <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">man</persName> obviously infatuated with <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">the young screen
               star</persName>. He speaks of <eventName type="contaction">writing two and three <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> a day and <objectName type="document">all the missives</objectName> were
               ended in a long series of “X’s” or kisses</eventName>.</p>
            
            <p>Typical of the character of these fervent <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> is the following extract: "<persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">My
               sweetheart</persName>, <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">my wife</persName>, <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">the mother of my children</persName>.” The last salutation was
               underlined.</p>

            <p>In <objectName type="document">the letter</objectName> <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> wrote telling <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> that all was over <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">she</persName> mentions an·
               "operation" performed: by <persName key="Hutchison" ref="#writer" role="unknown">Dr. Hutchison</persName>. <eventName type="love">It seems that <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> or <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">Mrs. Shelby</persName>
               arranged for this abortion</eventName>.</p> 
            
            <p>Only five persons, says <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName>, ever knew of the extent of <eventName type="love">this romance</eventName>. These were <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">her
               mother,</persName> <persName key="miles" ref="#family" role="unknown">her grandmother</persName>, now dead, <persName key="mshelby" ref="#family" role="unknown">her sister</persName> and <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName>.</p>
            
            <p><persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> claims that this definitely ended <eventName type="love">her romance with <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName></eventName> and that when she
               met <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">William Desmond Taylor</persName> a year or two later that <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">she</persName> realized that <eventName type="love"><persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">her</persName> affair with
               <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName></eventName> was merely an infatuation and that <eventName type="love"><persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">she</persName> really was in love with <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName></eventName>.</p>
            
            <p>She says, however, that a year after <eventName type="murder">Taylor's murder</eventName> <date>in February, 1922</date>, that <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName>
               came to <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">her</persName> and <eventName type="marry">wanted to marry <persName type="minter">her</persName></eventName>. <eventName type="marry">She says she keyused him</eventName> because she was still
               in love with <objectName>Taylor's ghost</objectName> and <time>a short time later</time>, <eventName type="marry">having obtained a <eventName>divorce</eventName> from
                  <persName key="Lila" ref="#family" role="romantic">his first wife</persName> <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">he</persName> married <persName key="Lila" ref="#family" role="romantic">Lila Lee</persName></eventName>.</p>
            
            <p><objectName type="document">Investigation</objectName> at <time>the present time</time>, although handicapped by <time>the passage of time</time>,
               indicates that <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> was in <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName> at the time of the <eventName type="murder">Taylor murder</eventName> at about
               <time>7:45 P.M</time>. <date>on the night of February 1, 1922</date>. <eventName type="love"><persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">He</persName> may even have been working on <placeName type="residence">the same
                  lot</placeName> with <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName></eventName>.</p>
            
            <p><objectName type="literature">Old directories</objectName> of <time>the period</time> give his address as the <orgName type="club">Los Angeles Athletic C1ub</orgName>, then
               the habitat of many screen personalities including <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Mickey Neilan</persName> and others. It was at the club that <eventName type="love">a story was widely circu1lated that <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> one night went to <placeName type="residence">Taylor's
               bungalow</placeName> and taking off all <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">her</persName> <objectName type="clothes">clothes</objectName> begging <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">him</persName> to have intercourse with <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">her</persName>.</eventName>
               <persName>Mrs. Shelby</persName> is said to have arrived <time>a few minutes after</time> <persName>Mary</persName> left and demanded <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">her
               daughter</persName>. <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> keyused to have anything to do with <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">the girl</persName> after. It is well
               established, however, that <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">the mother</persName> considered <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> a menace to her control over
               <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">her money-making daughter</persName> and hated <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">him</persName> accordingly.</p>
            
            <p>In a statement taken in <placeName>New York</placeName> in <time>1925</time> by former Chief Deputy District <persName key="Attorney" ref="#law_enforcement" role="unknown">Attorney
               Harold Davis</persName> <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName> recites that <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">her mother</persName> "tore"' up the earth when any man came
               around her.” She recalled on one occasion, according to <objectName type="document">the transcript</objectName> or <objectName type="document">the
                  statement</objectName>, that she was present <placeName type="transportation">at a railroad station</placeName> in <placeName type="Santa_Barbara">Santa Barbara</placeName> or Los Angeles.
               with <persName key="kirkwood" ref="#director" role="unknown">Kirkwood</persName> and others and the <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">mother</persName>, 'being momentarily displeased with <eventName type="talk"><persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName>,
               asserted that <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">she</persName> would kill anyone that came between <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">her</persName> and <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">Mary</persName></eventName>,” man or woman and
               even included a dog belonging to one of the company.</p>

            <p>The theory of every person closely connected with the <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> case – Taylor’s personal
               friends, intimates of the Shelby family -- has always been that <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="business">Mrs. Shelby</persName> either
