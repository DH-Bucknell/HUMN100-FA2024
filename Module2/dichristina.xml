            <byline>Lucy DiChristina</byline>
            <p> STATEMENT OF MISS MARY MILES MINTER. G.H BOONE OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT
               ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, February 7, 1922, at five o'clock P.M. [Part 4]
                  <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> said that to me, and looked right at me. I could
               feel myself grow red. I said, "Is that all you have to tell me about <persName ref="taylor">Mr
                  Taylor</persName>?" He said, "Well, I could recite some more instances about
                  <persName ref="taylor">Bill's</persName> seeming insanity." He said, "I am certain he was
               insane. He stood up and told those things as <eventName type="sober">soberly</eventName> as I am talking to you now." </p>
            <p> MR MOTT: Excuse me. Did he refer to <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor's</persName> physical
               condition? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Yes, he said he was <eventName type="drunk">drunk</eventName> at the time. <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> has
               told ma on several occasions, sometimes long ago and sometimes recently that he
               always hated to see <persName ref="taylor">Bill</persName> drink because he said, "You wouldn't
               know the man; he changes so; he gets maudlin and silly, smiles in a foolish manner
               and wobbles and talks, oh, just the silly, foolish things." He said, "None of his
               friends like to see him drink." At this time he was <eventName type="drunk">intoxicated</eventName> and he talked on and
               on and on about this thing." <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> said he got up and he told
               <persName ref="taylor"> Bill</persName>, "You are insane; something 1s the matter with your
               mind. I would certainly take more vengeance on you if I didn't think you were crazy,"
               and that was tbe opinion of <persName ref="hoyt">Arthur Hoyt</persName> and <persName ref="robinson">Cap
                  Robinson</persName> and everybody. They were perfectly amazed that a man of
               <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor's</persName> lovable, sweet, considerate, gentlemanly
               disposition all through life should suddenly turn around and say this about not only
               a woman, but about me, whom they all knew he admired and respected. </p>
            <p> When I heard of this thing, l just looked to <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> and said,
               "Is that all you have to tell me about <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>?" And he said,
               "Yes, that is all. That 1s the ghastly thing. I know you are going to hear this from
               somebody and I wanted you to hear it from me, and want to find out what you knew
               about the <eventName type="murder">murder</eventName> of this man." </p>
            <p> By this time I was getting -- Oh, how can I can I express it? -- just exhausted with
               shock, one shock after another and of all the shocks I had received, this coming from
               hlm who I had no reason to doubt his word, I couldn't believe it; not as I knew
               <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, I couldn't believe for an instant he had ever said
               these things to anybody, yet there <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> giving me names,
               dates and places. The thing was too much for me. I got furious; and I said, "I don't
               believe you! I think you are lying! How dare you say this about him to me! I never
               want to see you again?" He got up and walked around the room for a minute and I was
               just broiling; I was just furious; and he turned around and he said, "Well,
                  <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>, some day you will realize that I certainly am not
               saying this for any personal reason. It hurts me as it must hurt you. I am simply
               telling you because you are bound to know it; it is the truth and I wanted to be the
               one to tell you. </p>
            <p> Well, I didn't have any more to say to him. I was just furious; I was furious with
               him; and finally he talked and he said, more, more, more personal things about, "You
               know <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> that I care for you." </p>
            <p> DORAN: He told you he loved you, did he? </p>
            <p>MINTER: Yes; he did on <date type="friday">Friday</date> night. He said, "You know I care for you deeply." </p>
            <p> I said, "I don't care; I don't want you to care for me; I don't want <persName ref="jones">John
                  Jones</persName> to care for me or anybody; I don't want ever to be in <eventName type="love">love</eventName> again
               as long as I <eventName type="life">live</eventName>; I don't want to see any man; I hate men." I probably raved on. </p>
            <p> I dont know what more I can tell you. I was so tired, exhausted; I had been sitting
               up all <time type="night">night</time>. This conversation didn't come as quickly as I am te11ing it to you. It
               came with long pauses; he would get up and walk around with his <objectName type="posession">cigarette</objectName> smoking and
               come back again and go out and talk to the property man, go out of the <placeName>office</placeName>, and I
               would sit there alone and I tore a piece of paper, I was so tired, and suggested that
               we go <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>. I said, "Why keep sitting up? </p>
            <p> You have got to get up at <time type="morning">eight o'clock</time> in the <time type="morning">morning</time> and it is nearly <time type="morning">dawn</time>." He
               aaid, "I am worried about this thing; I want to find out what you know about this
               <eventName type="murder">murder</eventName>." Then it developed that <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> thought I knew
               something about it, and he looked at me and he said, "Now, <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>"
               -- he got a little profane, he said, "Now, <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>, for God's sake,
               if you know anything about the <eventName type="murder">murder</eventName> of <persName ref="taylor">Bill</persName> tell it to me
               now." He said, "Don't withhold anything." This was too much; not only had he been
               telling me these things about <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, but there he sat
               evidently believing that I knew someth1ng. I said, "Do you think that I <eventName type="murder">killed</eventName> <persName ref="taylor">Mr
               Taylor</persName>?" He said, "Oh, no; don't be silly. Now is no time to talk things like that. "
               He said, "I am just trying to find something out about this. This is going to be an
               awful <eventName type="affair">affair</eventName>." I said, "I didn't <eventName type="murder">kill</eventName> <persName ref="taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> and I don't know who
               <eventName type="murder">murdered</eventName> him." He said, "You don't? You don't know anything?" He said, "Of course,
               you didn't <eventName type="murder">kill</eventName> him; of course, you didn't put anybody on to do it, But" he said,
               "don't you know somebody, don't you know some inti­mate details that other people
               might not know? Can't you rack your brain and think who would have a motive for
               <eventName type="murder">killing</eventName> him?" </p>
            <p> Then he sat there and we said words about pro and con, trying to think, and I
               thought over everyrody I knew and I said this, more or less in a humourous way, I
               said, "The only person I know who could have had a possible motive for <eventName type="murder">killing</eventName> him
               would be <persName ref="ivers">Mrs. Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>." I was not serious when I said that. I was more
               or less humorous. She is a lady I feel I ought to explain about, who has never done
               me a wrong thing in her life and I have never done her a wrong thing, either, but she
               is a <persName ref="ivers">Christian Science lady</persName> who has been associated with him as a <orgName type="writer">scenario writer</orgName> for
               <time type="years">many years</time>; she is quite a trusted, lovely woman, I am sure; a very honorable
               respectable woman, but we don't like eaeh other. There is no reason, but we don't
               like each other. Every time I wanted to see him, somehow she would be there and she
               had a strange way of treating me. She would say, Oh yes, there is little <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName>. Here
               she comes." She would go on in this manner, "Oh, there is little <persName ref="minter">Mary</persName> again, Oh,
               there she is; wbat can she be want1ng this time? Oh, yes, uh huh." Quite a strange
               attitude, She just riled me. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Bow old a woman was she? </p>
            <p> MINTER: She must have been 50. Her son was <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor's</persName> <orgName type="job">camera man</orgName>. <persName ref="Jimmy">Jimmy</persName> was my
               <orgName type="job">camera man</orgName>, <persName ref="Jim">Jim Vantrees</persName>. I don't hate the woman, but she annoys me. She is one of
               the few people in the world I dislike to see. In fact, the irony of fate it was when
               I was in <placeName type="country">France</placeName> after looking at the beautifUl Venus de Milo in <placeName type="city">Paris</placeName> at the <placeName type="meusam">Louvre</placeName>,
               and after I had walked a few steps done a long hall, thinking of this excellent
               statue, who should I see but <persName ref="ivers">Julia Crawford Ivers</persName>, a very, fat, large woman. She did
               some more of these Christian Science things, and she had a very unpleasant habit of
               whenever she would be with me and <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, she would always come and twit my chin.
               So I said, in really a joking manner -- I don't want to accuse the woman, because I
               don't think she had anything to do with the matter -- I said "I don't know anyone who
               would kill him but <persName ref="ivers">Ju1ia Crawford Ivers</persName>." "I always suspected the woman of being in
               love with him herself or she might have <eventName type="murder">killed</eventName> him tor that reason." He said, "My
               goodness! You mustn't say that out loud; somebody w111 believe you." I said, "I don't
               care if they do." I was in such a wild mood, Then, -- What else did we talk about?
               Oh! He talked about his <orgName type="production">productions</orgName> and said, "I certainly have a terrible time,
               working <time type="day">day</time> and <time type="night">night</time> and a great deal depended upon <date type="saturday">Saturday</date> and we must get certain
               work finished <date type="friday">Friday</date>." We talked of <date type="friday">Friday</date> <time type="night">night</time> and that he had to get up at <time type="morning">eight
               o'clock</time>; he wasn't going to bed at all; that the boys were calling for him at <time type="morning">eight
               o'clock</time>, he said, and he knew if they didn't call he would never get up out of his
               <eventName type="sleep">slumbers</eventName>. They were going somewhere <placeName type="set">on location</placeName>, I understood, possibly at the
               <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>. He was just going <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> and take a <eventName type="bathe">shower</eventName>, get a <eventName type="bathe">shave</eventName> if he felt like it, and
               go on back and <eventName type="work">work</eventName> some more. He said, "I am dog tired. I was never so exhausted,
               just <eventName type="dead">dead</eventName>." Finally I said, "Do you rea1ize this looks awful, being here all this
               time?" And he said, "I can't help it if it does. I had to tell you these things and
               wanted to find out what you knew about this case. That I know you knew <persName ref="taylor">Bill</persName> very
               well, probably better than any of us and" -- Oh, yes. He also asked me to tel1 him my
               feelings toward <persName ref="taylor">Mr Taylor</persName>, exactly what everybody has been asking me, and I told him
               as I have been telling you, I loved him deeply, sincerely and absolutely; that I
               <eventName type="love">loved</eventName> him truly, <eventName type="love">loved</eventName> him in an all-around way, I cared for his health; his health
               came before my happiness and when he was ill -- and he didn't like to see anyone when
               he was <eventName type="sick">ill</eventName>-- my natural impulse was to go to him and be with him and sit up <time type="night">night</time>
               after <time type="night">night</time> with him, if necessary. l didn't do it; I didn t even attempt to, because
               he didn't want me to, and although I had sat in the dark, not knowing anything and
               worrying about it, I did that rather than intrude myself upon him when he didn't want
               me. </p>
            <p> DORAN: What time of <time type="night">night</time> dld you first meet -- What is this man's name? </p>
            <p> MINTER: <persName ref="neilan">Mr Neilan</persName>? </p>
            <p> DORAN: <persName ref="neilan">Mr Neilan</persName>, this particular night. </p>
            <p> MINTER: We went down to the <placeName type="station">Salt Lake station</placeName> after <time type="night">one</time>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: And you arrived at your <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>, was it, or his <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> or whose <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> was it where
               you were frying the eggs? </p>
            <p> MINTER: His <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>, <date type="friday">Friday</date> <time type="night">night</time>; it was really <date type="saturday">Saturday</date> <time type="morning">morning</time>, wasn't it? I call lt
               <date type="friday">Friday</date> <time type="night">night</time>, because it was still <time type="night">nighttime</time>. The five of us arrived there, oh, I
               don't know, he didn't finish <eventName type="work">work</eventName> until between <time type="morning">two-thirty and three o'c1ock</time>, maybe
               after three; I didn't have a <objectName type="jewelry">watch</objectName> at that time. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Row long approximatey do you suppose you spent talking in the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Now, let me see, we stayed at <persName ref="neilan">Marshall's</persName> <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> wtth the eggs and things at
               least an <time type="hours">hour</time>, maybe<time type="hours"> two hours</time>; I am not certain of that at all; I don't think much
               more than an <time type="hours">hour</time>. Then we went right on to the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>, </p>
            <p> DORAN: Do you suppose you spent a <time type="hours">couple of hours</time> down there? </p>
            <p> MINTER: I think maybe we spent a <time type="hours">couple of hours</time>; maybe <time type="hours">three hours</time>; it takes a good
               while to go from <placeName type= "station">Salt Lake station</placeName> up to <persName ref="neilan">Marshall's</persName> <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> on <placeName type="street">Sunset Boulevard</placeName>. It
               would take at least <time type="hours">forty-five minutes</time>, I think. Then it takes some time to go from
               his <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> to the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>, way out on <placeName type="street">Santa Monica Boulevard</placeName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Where was the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: On <placeName type="street">Santa Monica Boulevard</placeName>, the <placeName type="studio">Hollyood Studios</placeName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Did you suggest that you go down there with him? </p>
            <p> MINTER: He said, "Let's go on down" -- No, the first thing he said was "Let's get
               out of here. I am burning up alive." It was very cold when we came in the <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> and
               we put on steam and then he got terribly hot. I don't know what was the matter with
               me, I wouldn't take off my <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName>. He said, "If you are going to stay there and burn,
               let's go out and talk." We got in the <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> and drove around for a while. No, it is not
               a fact that he said in the <placeName type="residence">house</placeName>, "We must go to the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName> and talk." I think I said
               that at first; it is not so. He said, "Let's go out and talk." Then it was very
               bitterly cold <placeName type="outside">outside</placeName>, freez1ng ocld. </p>
            <p> DORAN: You left the rest of the party at the house? </p>
            <p> MINTER: No; <persName ref="swanson">Miss Swanson</persName> and <persName ref="jpickford">Mr Pickford</persName> got in <persName ref="jpickford">Mr Pickford's</persName> <objectName type="vehicle">Locomobile</objectName> and he said
               he ms going to take her <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>. She was very anxious to get to <placeName type="bed">bed</placeName> as she had to get up
               early and <eventName type="work">work</eventName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Then, you and <persName ref="neilan">Marshall Neilan</persName> <eventName type="drive">drove</eventName> around <time type="hours">awhile</time> and finally wound up in the
               <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Yes; we <eventName type="drive">drove</eventName> around, went out <placeName type="street">Sunset Boulevard</placeName> and went up -- We went along
               <placeName type="street">Hollywood Boulevard</placeName> for a while, </p>
            <p> DORAN: What did you discuss while you were <eventName type="drive">riding</eventName> around in the <placeName type="vehicle">machine</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Why, about this thing about<persName ref="taylor"> Mr Taylor</persName> and then also I was rather peeved na
               <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> at the time because I hadn't heard from him in weeks. "Peeved" is hardly the
               word. That sounds more as if I am interested in <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName>, and I am; I like him, but l
               wasn't caring particularly; I simply said, "Well, <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName>, it was not a very nice
               thing the way you ran off the last time. I understood they were going out to <eventName type="dinner">dinner</eventName>
               and you were coming to my <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> to <eventName type="dinner">dinner</eventName> and suddenly you went to <placeName type="city">San Francisco</placeName>
               without so much as a fare-thee-well."' He said, "You know I do those things." I said,
               "Yes, you do those things, and it ts very annoying, but your friends love you and
               love you yet in spite of those funny little tricks you do, darting here and there. I
               don't know, I am in no mood to take thia foolishness; I want good wholesome
               friendship, but I want to know when you are going to appear." Many times a whole
               <eventName type="dinner">dinner</eventName> has gotten cold waiting for him. When we had a <eventName type="dinner">dinner party</eventName> at our <placeName type="residence">house</placeName>, or
               other people have given <eventName type="party">parties</eventName>, they have waited on <persName ref="neilan">Marshall</persName> for <time type="hours">two or three hours</time>
               and he finally would come along smiling sweetly at everybody and they couldn't scold
               him. I was more or less taking him to task for his 1ife in general, saying he should
               not do those things; it was very annoying and I was not going to put up with it. He
               was sweet and Irish and said, "You wouldn't be angry with me?" And I said, "No, I
               wouldn't be." That is the way we got out of that. There was nothing serious in the
               talk, Just the way we always talked. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Then you finally went to the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Finally he said, "Now, I have got something very important to tell you,
               something that is going to hurt your feelings terribly, but I must tell you; we wi11
               go in the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName> and talk." Our teeth were chatter1ng with cold and we went in there
               and he turned on the steam and I sat in this <objectName type="clothing">fur coat</objectName> in a <objectName type="furniture">wicker chair</objectName>, and he said,
               "This is going to b, a nine or "nineteen-days talk of the world" Then he told me all
               the things I have been telling you. There may have been some more, and some thlngs I
               have said may not be exactly accurate, but the gist of the thing is entirely
               accurate. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Did he declare his <eventName type="love">love</eventName> for you, whi1e rid1ng around in the <objectName type="vehicle">machine</objectName>? </p>
            <p> MINTER: No, he did not. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Not until you reached the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName> did he do tha that? </p>
            <p> MINTER: Not until after we had been there a long time at the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>. </p>
            <p> DORAN: Was it before or after he told you about this instance in connection with
               <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> -- </p>
            <p> MINTER: It was afterwards. I don't know yet whether he really meant it; maybe he was
               as sincere as he could be, and he can be very sincere, I am sure. I am sure he can. </p>
