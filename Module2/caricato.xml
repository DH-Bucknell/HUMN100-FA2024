                     <date><time>Thursday morning</time></date>. When <persName ref="moreno"

                  >Moreno</persName> said <date>yesterday</date> that he had been an intimate friend
               of <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> for <time>several years</time>, since the
               time <persName ref="taylor">Taylor</persName> had become associated with <orgName

            <p>"He was one of the finest men I ever met," "<persName ref="moreno">Tony</persName>"
               said. "He had the highest ideals, I believe, of any man I've ever met in the

               <time>Thursday night</time>, <date>January 27</date>, were given by
                  <persName ref="moreno">Moreno</persName>, as well as an <eventName type="meeting">informal meeting</eventName>
               held between <persName ref="moreno">Moreno</persName>, <persName ref="taylor"

            <p>"I left them there <time>about 7 o'clock</time>," <persName ref="moreno"
                  >Moreno</persName> said, "to go to a <eventName type="party">dinner party</eventName> at
                  <placeName type="hotel">the Ambassador</placeName>, which I had arranged for
                  <persName ref="relationship">a friend</persName> visiting here from <placeName type="city"
                  >Chicago</placeName>. Later, I understand, the three went to <eventName

               <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>."</p>
            <p><persName ref="moreno">Moreno</persName> declared he had spent <time><date>about two

               at <placeName type="film">the Vitagraph studio</placeName>, where <persName ref="moreno"
                  >Moreno</persName> is working. He had an <eventName type="meeting">appointment</eventName> with
               him for <date>Tuesday</date>, also, but the director, according to <persName
                  ref="moreno">Moreno</persName>, did not fill it because of a
                  <eventName type="travel">trip</eventName> to <placeName type="mountain">Mount Lowe</placeName> on location.</p>
            <p>"Then I called him again <date><time>Wednesday night</time></date>," <persName
                  ref="moreno">Moreno</persName> said, "<time>about 6 o'clock</time>. His boy,

                  phone</objectName>. <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was not
                  <placeName type="residence">at home</placeName>. However, he called me later, <time>about 7</time>,
               and we arranged that I should call for <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>,
               at the <placeName type="film">Lasky studio</placeName>, <date><time>about 10 o'clock
                     Thursday morning</time></date>. <persName ref="hoyt">Mr. Hoyt</persName> was with me in

            <p>"But--" and here <persName ref="moreno">Moreno</persName> gave a sorrowful shake of
               his head--"But you know the rest. The <eventName type="meeting"
                  >appointment</eventName> was not fulfilled--and never will be. "I feel that in

                  >404-B South Alvarado Street</placeName>. He did not appear to have any

            <p>This was disclosed yesterday by <persName ref="moreno">Tony Moreno</persName>,

            <p>"The <date>next day</date> I saw him again. I met him at <placeName type="hotel">the

               There were a number of picture people there <date>that night</date>.
                     "<date><time>Saturday night</time></date>--that is, <date><time>a week ago

                  near <placeName type="city">Pasadena</placeName>,</placeName> and had something to eat there. From there they drove
               to the <placeName type="club">Annandale Country Club</placeName>.</p>
            <p>"I saw <persName ref="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> next at the <placeName
