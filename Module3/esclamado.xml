            <p>BY THE CORONER:</p>

            <p>NANCE: Please state your name.</p>

            <p>EYTON:<persName key="eyton" role="manager">Charles Eyton</persName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Where do you reside?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <placeName type="address">1920 Vine Street, Hollywood</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: What is your occupation?</p>

            <p>EYTON: General Manager, <orgName type="production">Famous Players-Lasky
                  Corporation</orgName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE:<persName key="eyton" role="manager">Mr. Eyton</persName>, have you seen the
                  <objectName type="body">remains</objectName> of the <objectName type="body">deceased</objectName> in the
               adjoining <placeName type="house">room</placeName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Do you recognize them as one you knew in life?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Who was it.</p>

            <p>EYTON:<persName key="taylor" role="director">William Desmond Taylor</persName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Where was he born?</p>

            <p>EYTON: He was born in <placeName type="country">Ireland</placeName>, to the best of my
               knowledge. He told me so.</p>

            <p>NANCE: What was his age?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Forty-four, I should judge. [He was forty-nine.]</p>

            <p>NANCE: Was he married, single or a widower?</p>

            <p>EYTON: He was married. [He was divorced as of <date>1916</date>.]</p>

            <p>NANCE: When did he die?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <date>Thursday morning</date> or <date>Wednesday night</date>. I
               saw the <objectName type="body">body</objectName> first on <date>Thursday morning</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: <date>Last Thursday</date>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Do you recall that date?</p>

            <p>EYTON: It was <date>the 2nd</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: <date>February 2nd?</date></p>

            <p>EYTON: <date>February 2nd</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Where did he die?</p>

            <p>EYTON: EYTON: the EYTON: <placeName type="address">Apartment
                  "B," South Alvarado Street, 404</placeName> I think it was.</p>

            <p>NANCE: What was the cause of his death, if you know?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Well,<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor's</persName> assistant <persName key="harryFellows" role="assistantDirector">[Harry
                  Fellows]</persName> rang me up at my residence about, I should
               judge, <time>eight o'clock</time>, and told me<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor</persName> had died
               suddenly; so I immediately went over to his residence, and he
               was lying on the <objectName type="floor">floor</objectName> on his <objectName type="bodyPart">back</objectName>.
                 <persName key="ziegler" role="detective">Detective Ziegler</persName> was there and he had called the doctor, he told me,
               previous to my arrival; and the doctor told me<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor</persName> had died from
               hemorrhage of the <objectName type="bodyPart">stomach</objectName>. <persName key="dougMaclean">Mr. Maclean - Douglas
                  Maclean</persName> - had told me that he had thought he had heard <objectName type="gun">a
                  shot</objectName>
               <date>the night before</date>, and his wife also thought she had heard <objectName type="gun">a
                  shot</objectName> - and he wanted the <objectName type="body">body</objectName> turned over;
               they didn't want to turn it over until the coroner came. The <persName key="coroner">deputy coroner</persName> came
               after a while, and he told us he had died of hemorrhage of the
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">stomach</objectName>, and I told him he had better turn the
                  <objectName type="body">body</objectName> over to make sure, and he put his
               <objectName type="bodyPart">hand</objectName> under<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="body">body</objectName>, and found a little - when he pulled his
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">hand</objectName> out, it had a little <objectName type="bodyPart">blood</objectName>
               on his <objectName type="bodyPart">hand</objectName>. <persName key="dougMaclean">Douglas</persName> asked him what that was,
               and he said it evidently had run down from his<persName key="taylor" role="director">[Taylor's]</persName>
               <objectName type="bodyPart">mouth</objectName>, but I noticed that there was no <objectName type="bodyPart">trail of
                  blood</objectName>-<persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName> was in a <objectName type="bodyPart">pool of blood</objectName> - there
               was no <objectName type="bodyPart">trail of blood</objectName> running down. </p>
            
            <p>NANCE: There was a <objectName type="bodyPart">pool of blood</objectName> under his
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Under his <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName>, yes, a little
               <objectName type="bodyPart">pool of blood</objectName>. I immediately opened up<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr.
                  Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="clothing">vest</objectName>, and looked, and looked on the right-hand side, and
               there was no mark. I looked on the left-hand side and saw some
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">blood</objectName>, and then I told the <persName key="coroner">Deputy Coroner</persName>
               that I thought that evidence enough to turn his <objectName type="body">body</objectName> over to
               see what would happen. I sent for a <objectName type="furniture">pillow</objectName> to put under
              <persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
               <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName>, and we turned him over - the <persName key="coroner">Deputy
                  Coroner</persName> and myself - and we pulled his <objectName type="clothing">shirt</objectName> and
               his <objectName type="clothing">vest</objectName> up, and we found the <objectName type="body">bullet
                  wound</objectName>. </p>
            
            <p>NANCE:<persName key="eyton" role="manager">Mr. Eyton</persName>, was his <objectName type="body">body</objectName>
               stone cold at that time?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Stone cold and very stiff and rigid.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Indicating that it had been dead for some time?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Where was the <objectName type="body">body</objectName> lying with keyerence
               to the <placeName type="passage">front entrance</placeName> to his
               <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: It was lying right in front of a little
                  <objectName type="furniture">desk</objectName> with the <objectName type="bodyPart">head</objectName> pointed east
               and the feet pointed west. I should judge the <objectName type="bodyPart">feet</objectName> were
               three or four feet from the <placeName type="passage">door</placeName> - the <placeName type="passage">front
                  entrance</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Who were present when you was there?</p>

            <p>EYTON: When I came in, the first man I noticed was<persName key="ziegler" role="detective">Detective
                  Ziegler</persName>, whom I have known for a number of years, and <persName key="dougMaclean">Douglas
                  Maclean</persName>; <persName key="maigne">Charles Maigne</persName>; the landlord <persName key="jessurun" role="landlord"> [E. C.
                     Jessurun]</persName>; and <persName key="harryFellows" role="assistantDirector">Harry Fellows</persName>,<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
               assistant director.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Did all of these persons live there in this
                  <placeName type="residence">neighborhood</placeName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: That I could not tell you. <persName key="dougMaclean">Mr. MacLean</persName> did, I know,
               because he showed me where his <placeName type="residence">apartment</placeName> was.</p>

            <p>NANCE: The place<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor</persName> lived was in a
                  <placeName type="residence">court</placeName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: In a <placeName type="residence">court</placeName>, yes.</p>

            <p>NANCE: These other <objectName type="building">buildings</objectName> were nearby?</p>

            <p>EYTON: There are several <placeName type="residence">apartments</placeName> in this
                  <placeName type="residence">court</placeName>, all the way around.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Did <persName key="dougMaclean">Mr. and Mrs. MacLean</persName>, or either of them, tell
               you about the <time>hour</time> that they heard the
               <objectName type="gun">gunshot</objectName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, <persName key="dougMaclean">Mr. Maclean</persName> told me it was <time>about
                  eight</time> or a <time>quarter after eight</time>, and <persName key="faithMaclean">Mrs. Maclean</persName>
               thought it was <time>a little later</time>. [This is not correct.]</p>

            <p>NANCE: <date>That night?</date></p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes, <date>the night before</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You didn't make any definite measurements as to the position of
               the <objectName type="body">body</objectName>?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No, sir.</p>

            <p>NANCE: So that what you testified to is only an estimate, and nothing
               definite about it.</p>

            <p>EYTON: Yes.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Now, how long has<persName key="taylor" role="director">Mr. Taylor</persName> lived in this
               place?</p>

            <p>EYTON: That I could not tell you. He lived in it before he went to
                  <eventName type="war">the war</eventName>, I believe.</p>

            <p>NANCE: When did you last see him alive?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <date>The same day</date> - <date>Wednesday</date>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Now, did he have any <objectName type="gun">fire-arms</objectName> of his
               own?</p>

            <p>EYTON: I believe he had a <objectName type="gun">revolver</objectName>; I believe
               the <objectName type="gun">revolver</objectName> was in the <objectName type="furniture">upper
                  drawer</objectName>
               <placeName type="location">upstairs</placeName>; in fact, I know there was, because<persName key="ziegler" role="detective">Detective
                  Ziegler</persName> and myself went up there and saw it.</p>

            <p>NANCE: When you were called to this place, did you see any
                  <objectName type="gun">fire-arms</objectName> in this <placeName type="house">room</placeName> where he
               was?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No.</p>

            <p>NANCE: What is the name of his valet, or attendant there?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <persName key="peavey" role="houseAssistant">Harry Peavey</persName>, the colored cook. I never knew him or
               saw him.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Was he the one who called you?</p>

            <p>EYTON: <persName key="harryFellows" role="assistantDirector">Harry Fellows</persName>, his assistant director, was the one
               who called me.</p>

            <p>NANCE: You have no independent knowledge of the manner in which he met
               his death?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No, sire.</p>

            <p>THE CORONER: Have you any questions, gentlemen?</p>

            <p>NANCE: (By <persName key="juror">a Juror</persName>) Was his
                  <objectName type="clothing">clothing</objectName> ruffled in any way, showing any violence?</p>

            <p>EYTON: No, absolutely none; it looked like he just walked in the
                  <placeName type="passage">door</placeName> and was shot in the <objectName type="bodyPart">back</objectName>;
               that is the way it looked. It didn't show evidence in the <placeName type="house">room</placeName>
               when I got there- neither the <placeName type="house">room</placeName> or the
                  <objectName type="body">body</objectName> showed any evidence of a struggle. He had on the
               same <objectName type="clothing">suit</objectName> as when I seen him <date>the day before</date>
               when he talked to me.</p>

            <p>THE CORONER: Is there any other questions? That is all, you may be
               excused.</p>
