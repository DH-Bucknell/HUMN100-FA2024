               Interviews with <persName key="ethel">Ethel Mae Harrison</persName>
               
              <date>February 13, 1922</date>
              <orgName type="newspaper">NEW YORK HERALD</orgName> </p>
           
            <p>...<persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName>, who married <persName key="Taylor">William Cunningham Deane-Tanner</persName>, or <persName key="Taylor">William
               Desmond Taylor</persName>, as he was later known, in <date>1902</date>, said her former husband had
               spent some time on a <placeName type="job">pony ranch</placeName> in <placeName type="region">southwestern</placeName> <placeName type="state">Kansas</placeName> before <persName key="ethel">she</persName> met him in
               <placeName key="city">New York</placeName>.  The only information she had ever had was that which <persName key="Taylor">Deane-Tanner</persName>
               gave her personally.</p>
            
            <p>"<persName key="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner</persName> told me that when he arrived here from <placeName type="country">Ireland</placeName> he had
               gone out to this <placeName type="job">ranch</placeName>," <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said, "and his family in <placeName type="country">Ireland</placeName> had
               <eventName type="investment">bought</eventName> for him a part interest in it.  When I met him he keyerred to it and
               told me a flaw in the <objectName type="document">title</objectName> had forced several of the shareholders,
               including <persName key="Taylor">himself</persName>, to give up their part, and he then joined the <orgName type="company">Davenport
               road company</orgName>.  After the failure of his venture in <placeName>Kansas</placeName> he returned to his
               home in <placeName type="country">Ireland</placeName> for a visit.</p>
            
            <p>"With keyerence to the claim of this <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> in <placeName key="state">California</placeName> that he
               is the son of the murdered <persName key="Taylor">director</persName>, I would not like to say flatly that the
               claim is or is not true, for I knew little of <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner's</persName> life on the
               <placeName type="job">ranch</placeName> in <placeName type="state">Kansas</placeName> and did not find it necessary to catechize him minutely, and
               he never mentioned anything to me about having been married out there.
               Perhaps there is some truth in the story, or it may be another of the many
               persons who come forward whenever there is an <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> to be settled.  I have
               been interested in the number of persons who claim <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner</persName>, or
                  <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, was their father.  To date he must have had at least six or seven
                  children besides my own daughter, if the stories are all correct.  As <persName key="Taylor">Mr.
               Deane-Tanner</persName> would only be about <time>fifty years</time> old now, that is rather
               ridiculous, I think."</p>
             
            <p> keyerring to the criminal end of the case, <persName key= "ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> criticized the
               work of the <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName> detectives and prosecutors, saying they do not seem
               to be particularly anxious to solve the mystery of the identity of the
               murderer.</p>
               
            <p>"<persName key="ethel">I</persName> have bitterly resented the accounts printed in some of the
               newspapers here that my daughter and myself are merely interested in the
               financial part of the affair and are more interested in the <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> <objectName key="money">estate</objectName>
               than in the identity of the person who killed my former husband.  This is
               absolutely untrue, for, as <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> former wife, I am deeply grieved at
               this terrible affair and am anxious to see the guilty person punished."
               Returning to the discussion of the claim of the man who says the <persName key="Taylor">movie
               director</persName> was his <persName key="Taylor">father</persName>, <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said that it seemed improbable that her
               first husband ever used the name of <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> before he left <placeName type="city">New York</placeName> in <date>1908</date>.
               <persName key="ethel">She</persName> said that to old friends who knew him when he first came to <placeName type="country">this country</placeName>
               and had been in constant touch with him during his stay in <placeName type="state">Kansas</placeName> nothing
               was known of any marriage while he was in the <placeName>West</placeName>.  After that, and until
               he <eventName type="leaving">disappeared</eventName>, <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said, he never used the name of <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, or
               keyerred extensively to his visit to the <placeName type="job">ranch</placeName> in the <placeName type="region">West</placeName>.</p>
            
            <p>"I never really knew <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner's</persName> right age," <persName>Mrs. Robins</persName> said,
               "and I understood that he had been in <placeName type="country">his country</placeName> about eight or nine years,
               when I <eventName type="marriage">married</eventName> him at the <orgName type="church">Little Church Around the Corner</orgName> in <date>1901</date>.  He was a
               fine, lovable man, and I never had occasion to closely question him about
               his 'past,' which every one seems trying to <eventName type="investigation">dig up</eventName>."</p>
              
            <p>No decision whether <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> or her daughter, <persName key="daughter">Ethel</persName>, will go to
               <placeName type="state">California</placeName> in connection with the settling of the <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> has been reached.
               <persName key="frank">Frank E. Schrenseisen</persName> of <placeName type="city">New Rochelle</placeName>, attorney for <persName>Miss Tanner</persName>, said that
               he was awaiting developments and instructions from the office of the Public
               <title type="politician">Administrator</title> in <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName>.  Another attorney for <persName key="ethel">Miss Tanner</persName> has been
               engaged in <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName>.  Should the <title type="politician">Public Administrator</title> place credence in
                  the story of <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, it is probable that <persName key="ethel">Miss Tanner</persName> will accompany her
               attorney to <placeName type="region">the coast</placeName>.</p>
           
            <p> "<persName key="Taylor">Mr. Deane-Tanner</persName> told my <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName> that he had made a <objectName type="document">will</objectName> in her
               favor," <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said, "and had placed it in his <objectName type="bank">safe deposit box</objectName>.  I
               understand that this is another one of the <objectName type="document">items</objectName> which the <orgName type="law">police</orgName> say have
               strangely '<eventName type="disapearnce">disappeared</eventName>.'  What he did with it I have no idea, but I feel
               that the entire matter will be straightened out.  Just at present I am
               hoping that the murderer of <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> will be brought to justice for this
               terrible crime."</p>
              
            <p><persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> commented on the strange disappearance of <persName key="dennis">Dennis Deane-
               Tanner</persName>, <persName key="dennis">brother</persName> of the murdered <persName key="Taylor">director</persName>, and said she had never heard a
               word from him since he left this <placeName type="city">city</placeName> in <date>1912</date>, just <time>four years</time> after her
               husband <eventName type="disappearance">disappeared</eventName>.  She said the two brothers had been good friends and
               business associates, and that <persName key="dennis">Dennis</persName> had visited their home at <placeName type="town">Larchmont</placeName> on
               several occasions, and had met many of their friends.  There was never any
               trouble between the brothers as far as she knew, <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins </persName>said.</p>
            
               <p><date>February 14, 1922</date>
               <orgName type="newspaper">NEW YORK AMERICAN</orgName></p>
              
            <p>To the two names suggested in the <orgName type="newspaper">New York American</orgName> <date>yesterday</date>--<persName key="sands">Edward
               F. Sands</persName> and <persName key="dennis">Dennis Gage Deane-Tanner</persName> as persons whose discovery may furnish
               a clue to the identity of the slayer of <persName key="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>--was added
               <date>yesterday</date> a third.</p>
             
            <p> The third person is a woman, a fascinating blonde who was the companion
               of <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> (or <persName key="Taylor">W. C. Deane-Tanner</persName>, as he was then known) on a trip through
               the <placeName type="region">Adirondacks</placeName> during the <date>Summer of 1908</date>, <date>three months prior</date> to the sudden
               disappearance of <persName key="Taylor">"Pete" Tanner</persName> in <date>late October, 1908</date>.</p>
              
            <p>This woman, who had completely enchained the fancy of the aristocratic,
               handsome <persName key="Taylor">Tanner</persName>, was married.  Her identity is said to be known to a few of
               <persName key="Taylor">Tanner's</persName> associates of the old days when he was a director in the <orgName type="company">A. J.
               Crawford Company</orgName> firm at <placeName type="address">No. 253 Fifth avenue</placeName>.  She was the co-respondent in
               the divorce <eventName type="divorce">suit</eventName> instituted some two years after <persName key="Taylor">"Pete" Tanner's</persName>
               disappearance by <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Ethel May Hamilton Robins</persName>, now the wife of <persName key="robins">Edward L.
               C. Robins</persName>, managing proprietor of <orgName type="restaurant">Delmonico's</orgName>.</p>
              
            <p>Does this hitherto hidden episode in the life of the murdered <persName key="Taylor">man</persName> bear
               any significance upon the crime?</p>
               
            <p>Was the woman's husband implacably determined to <eventName type="revenge">avenge</eventName> himself upon
               the <persName key="Taylor">man</persName> who had won the affections of his wife?</p>
              
            <p>Was it the hand of the husband that <eventName type="murder">fired</eventName> the fatal <objectName type="bullet">bullet</objectName> (from twelve
               to fourteen years old, according to the testimony of experts in ballistics)
               that killed <persName key="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>?</p>
              
            <p> ...At her home, <placeName type="house">Orienta Point,</placeName> <placeName type="town">Mamaroneck</placeName>, <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName>, former wife of
               the slain <persName key="Taylor">director</persName>, <date>yesterday</date> keyused to discuss this episode in the life of
               her former <persName key="Taylor">husband</persName>.  <persName key="ethel">She</persName> keyused to see <persName key="reporter">newspaper men</persName> but told a friend:
               "<persName key="ethel">I</persName> would do anything in my power to solve the mystery of <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Tanner's</persName>
               death but I do not think there can be any possible relation between this
               incident and the crime.  It was not until <date>long after</date> <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Tanner's</persName>
               disappearance that I learned definitely there was another woman in his life.
               "This information was placed in the hands of my attorney, <persName key="george">Mr. George
               Thoms</persName>, and he brought a successful <eventName type="divorce">suit</eventName> for divorce against <persName>Mr. Tanner</persName>.
               This was in <date>the latter part of 1918</date> [sic].  At that time I did not know
               whether <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Tanner</persName> was dead or alive.</p>
             
            <p>"It was <date>later</date>, perhaps <date>seven years ago</date>, that I <eventName type="recognize">saw</eventName> <persName key="Taylor">Mr. Tanner</persName> for the
               first time on the screen.  I cannot remember the name of the photoplay in
               which he appeared.  However, it was not until <date>two and one-half years ago</date>
               that I learned definitely that <persName key="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName> was my former
               husband."</p>

            <p> <placeName type="city">New York</placeName>, <date>Feb. 14</date> -- Of the many screen stars he knew, some of whom
               have been thrown squarely into the spotlight by the unrelenting inquiry into
               his association with <persName key="Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>, slain director, mentioned but
               one--<persName key="minter">Mary Miles Minter</persName>--in his letters to his nineteen-year-old <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName>,
               <persName key="daughter">Miss Ethel Daisy Deane-Tanner</persName>.</p>
              
            <p> Disclosing this fact to a reporter today, <persName key="daughter">Miss Tanner</persName> and her mother,
               <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Edward L. C. Robins</persName>, who live in <placeName type="town">Mamaroneck</placeName>, both of whom were <eventName type="abondon">deserted</eventName>
               by the man of mystery in <date>1908</date>, said that <persName key="minter">Miss Minter's</persName> name was used by the
               <persName key="Taylor">director</persName> only in an impersonal way.</p>
               
            <p><persName key="Taylor">He</persName> keyerred to <persName key="minter">her</persName> as an actress of ability, and said he had directed
               <persName key="minter">her</persName> in some of her photoplays.  This was one of the last letters written to
               his daughter by <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> before he was <eventName type="murder">murdered</eventName> in his <placeName type="city">Los Angeles</placeName> <placeName type="house">bungalow</placeName>.
               <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> and her <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName> expressly asserted that the name of <persName key="mabel">Mabel
               Normand</persName>, screen comedienne, and last person to see the director alive, did
               not appear in <persName key="Taylor">Taylor's</persName> letters to his <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName>, which had been more or less
               frequent during the <date>last two years</date>.</p>
               
            <p>Curiously enough, (and one reason why <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> is increasingly
               inclined to the opinion that her husband's sudden <eventName type="abandon">disappearance</eventName> from <placeName type="city">New
               York</placeName> was due to loss of memory), her former husband never mentioned her in
               the letters.</p>
              
            <p>Another reason for this belief, she declared, was that on the times she
               and her <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName> lunched here with <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName>--after it was definitely
               established that <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> was in reality <persName key="Taylor">Deane-Tanner</persName>--he never mentioned the
               fact that he <eventName type="abandon">deserted</eventName> his <persName key="ethel">wife</persName> and <persName type="ethel">daughter</persName>.  On these occasions all three
               felt the subject was rather delicate and it was never brought up.
               <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said that when <persName type="ethel">she</persName> and her <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName> became convinced <date>two
               years ago</date>, after seeing pictures of <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, that he was the girl's father,
               <persName key="daughter">Miss Deane-Tanner</persName> took the initiative and wrote to him.  His reply came
               <time>immediately</time>.</p>
            
            <p>In it he said he was very glad to hear from her; that he had not heard
               from he for so <time>long</time> that he thought <persName key="daughter">she</persName> was dead.  This is one more reason
               why <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> believes her former <persName key="Taylor">husband</persName> was a victim of aphasia when he
               left, after attending the <placeName type="town">Vanderbilt</placeName> cup races in <date>1908</date>.
               <persName>Taylor</persName> also, <persName>Mrs. Robins</persName> asserted, was unable to recall friends of
               their married life, and when their names were mentioned, his face failed to
               show the slightest signs of remembrance.  He did remember, however, favorite
               dishes of his former wife when he was dining with his daughter, pointing
               them out to the latter on the menu during their luncheon together.
               <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> declared that these points proved that his mind, while
               vague as to consequential facts about <persName key="ethel">her</persName> married life with the <persName key="Taylor">director</persName>,
               retained minor details.</p>
             
            <p> The director's experiences in <placeName type="state">Alaska</placeName> also were set forth in one <objectName type="letter">letter</objectName>.
               <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> told of how he contracted scurvy, consequently suffering from loss of
               hair, headaches and neuralgia.  Another letter dismissed with a few scornful
               words <persName key="sands">Sands</persName>, his chauffeur, who is still being sought by <orgName type="law">police</orgName>.  The
               <persName key="Taylor">director</persName> declared <persName key="sands">Sands</persName> had upset his home and said his name had been forged
               to checks by his unfaithful servant.</p>
              
            <p>Signatures <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> used in his letters to his <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName>, for whom he
               showed deep devotion, were "<persName key="Taylor">Father</persName>" and "<persName key="Taylor">Daddy Pete</persName>."  The origin of how
               <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName> came to be known as "<persName key="Taylor">Pete</persName>" was explained by <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName>.  She said
               when <persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, or as he was known then, <persName key="Taylor">Deane-Tanner</persName>, first came to live in
               <placeName type="city">New York</placeName> he took lodging with several Englishmen.</p>
             
               <p><persName key="Taylor">Taylor</persName>, always deliberate and calculating in his methods, was nicknamed
               "<persName key="Taylor">P. D. Q.</persName>," by his roommates, which was quickly shortened to "<persName key="Taylor">Pete</persName>."
               The <persName key="Taylor">director's</persName> promise to leave his <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> to his <persName key="daughter">daughter</persName> was
               contained in a <objectName type="letter">letter</objectName> written in <date>February, 1920</date>.  <persName key="ethel">Mrs. Robins</persName> said her
               former husband said in this message he thought it would be good policy to
               leave them both an <objectName type="money">annuity</objectName>, in addition to telling of his <objectName type="document">will</objectName> bequeathing
               his <objectName type="money">estate</objectName> to <persName key="daughter">Ethel Daisy</persName>.</p>

            <p> [relating the testimony of <persName key="Taylor">Taylor's</persName> <persName key="ethel">wife</persName> during the divorce <eventName type="divorce">hearing</eventName> in
               <date>1911</date>]...<persName key="ethel">Mrs. Tanner</persName>, in her testimony, said she was married on
               <date>December 7, 1901</date>, at the <orgName type="church">Little Church Around the Corner</orgName>.
               The ceremony was performed by <persName key="reverend">Rev. George C. Houghton</persName>, pastor of the
               church.  Following the marriage the couple went to live at <placeName type="adress">No. 40 Washington
               Square South</placeName>, and later moved to the <placeName type="hotel">Hotel Colonial</placeName> at <placeName type="street">Columbus Avenue</placeName> and
               <placeName type="street">Eighty-first street</placeName>, at which time her husband became associated with <orgName type="company">A. J.

               when he was stopping at the <placeName>Broadway Central Hotel</placeName>.  He sent word to the
               <orgName type="company">Crawford firm</orgName> asking for a sum of <objectName type="money">money</objectName>.  This was sent to him by <persName type="Daniel">Daniel J.
