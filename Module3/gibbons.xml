               <persName key="sands">Sands</persName> read every letter that came into the house for him. </p>
            <p> POLICE: Did <persName key="taylor">Taylor</persName> also tell you he didn't know how he found out so much, but he was

               of that sort, with me, I will let him know where I get off at, you see, and where he
               gets off," ** </p>
            <p> POLICE: Do you know whether <persName key="sands">Sands</persName> had any means of finding out whether or not <persName key="taylor">Taylor</persName>

               used, and the douche bag had been used and <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> had suppositories there at one
               time. </p>
            <p> POLICE: Did <persName key="sands">Sands</persName> ever tell you what women he suspected of spending the night out at

               I love you," I seen that note at <persName key="taylor">Taylor's</persName> house myself. </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: (After telling how <persName key="minter">Mary</persName> had been told over the phone that <persName key="taylor">Taylor</persName> wasn't
               home, that <persName key="minter">Mary</persName> would drive over to the house and catch <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> there) She would
               be given to understand he wasn't there, and she would get in her <objectName type="vechile">car</objectName> and come over,
               and find him there. I have seen her coming out of the <placeName type="residence">house</placeName> as if she were about
               ready to cry her eyes out. (<persName key="minter">M.M. Minter</persName>) </p>

            <p> TIFFANY: Well, sometimes, well, he would be waiting there and I would go on home and
               he would come out and say he wouldn't need me anymore, to go on home ** The next
               morning I would take him to the studio and Jazz (<persName key="sands">Sands</persName>) would say "Let's go up and
               see who slept with the old man last night." </p>

            <p> POLICE: Did she speak to him? </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: No; she said he turned and looked right at the <objectName type="vechile">street car</objectName>, and looked right
               at her as if he didn't recognize her, and she said she had a notion to get off the
               car ** ** it just started, you know ** </p>
            <p> POLICE: Did she say anything about his clothing being the same as it used to be, or
               different? </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: She said he had on a <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>, a <objectName type="clothing">grey cap</objectName> and <objectName type="clothing">grey overcoat</objectName>, one of these what
               you call them, a certain kind of <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName>. </p>
            <p> POLICE: Gaberdine? </p>

            <p> POLICE: Did he wear <objectName type="accessory">glasses</objectName>? </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: No, not to my knowledge. **** Jazz wore about a 7 <objectName type="accessory">shoe</objectName>. </p>
            <p> POLICE: How about <persName key="sands">Sands'</persName> eyebrows coming together over his nose. Did they do that?
               ** </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: Not quite. I remember one thing, they were a perfectly straight line, </p>
            <p> POLICE: Not arched? </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: No; they sort of came up favoring the upward turn more than any other way. </p>
            <p> POLICE: What was his nationality? </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: I think English, with a little Scotch. **** Without a doubt he had a

            <p> TIFFANY: He had a <objectName type="gun">Colt's</objectName>, whether that was his or <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> I don't know. **** I
               was down town with him several times, and he carried it with him once or twice to my
               knowledge, and he would stick it alongside the <objectName type="vechile">car</objectName> and I would ask him what was the
               idea, and he just laughed about it, was all, but the man was a coward. ** </p>
            <p> POLICE: Is he (<persName key="sands">Sands</persName>) hairy, is his breast hairy? </p>
            <p> TIFFANY: Well yes to an extent, that is where it is long. </p>
