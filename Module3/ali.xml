            <p>Questions by <persName key="doran" ref= "#law_enforcement" role = "investigator" >Mr. Doran</persName>: </p>

            <p> DORAN: How long have you known <persName key="taylor" >Mr taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Since <date when="1919-07">July of 1919</date> -- yes, that is correct. </p>

            <p> DORAN: He has been your director in pictures, has he? </p>

            <p> MINTER: Yes we commenced this <orgName type="company">company</orgName> together. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Did you have occasion to call on him at <placeName type="residence">his
                  residence</placeName> within <date type="month"> the last thirty days</date> prior
               to his death? -- approximately <date type="month"> thirty days?</date>
            </p>

            <p> MINTER: Just a moment, will you --</p>

            <p> DORAN: Let me change the question. When was the last time you called on him at
                  <placeName type="taylorshouse">his residence</placeName>? </p>

            <p> MINTER: On the <date type="murderday">23rd of December.</date>
            </p>
            <p>DORAN: Were you alone at that time or did others accompany you to see him? </p>

            <p> MINTER: I was alone. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Was any one else there?</p>

            <p>MINTER: no, not a soul. </p>

            <p>DORAN: Was <persName key="Sands" ref= "#servant" role = "employee" >his valet</persName>, the colored man, there, do you
               know?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Not that I know of. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Prior to that time, was it your habit to call on him at his residence or had
               it been your habit?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I couldn't call it a habit, but <date type="severaloccasions">on several
                  occasions</date> I did call upon him, though never asÂ·1ate as upon this
               occasion.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Now, on this last occasion, whet time of the day or night was it that you
               called? </p>

            <p>MINTER: May l tell this in my own way? </p>

            <p>DORAN: Yes, I would rather have you tell it in your own way, if you will.</p>

            <p> MINTER: I am glad to. I am trying to answer as I would in court and 1 don't like to
               do so. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Just proceed, go ahead and tell it in your own way.</p>

            <p>MINTER: I had gone to <objectName type="furniture">bed</objectName>; I hadn't seen
                  <persName key="taylor">Mr taylor</persName> in <date type="fivemonthsago">five
                  months</date> at the time -- <date>three months,</date> I know; three months, and
               I just got to thinking about it and I decided I couldn't stand it any longer. I was
               going to go up and tell him "goodbye. I got up and dressed, went down to my
                  <placeName type="house">grandmother's room</placeName> and I said, <persName
                  key="cshelby">"Mama,</persName> I am going over to say 'goodbye' to Mr taylor,"
               and she advised me not to do it. She said it was too late: "Do you know it is nearly
                  <time type="12oclock">twelve o'clock?</time>" she said. I said, "Yes, sure, but I
               just must do so," I said, "I realize that this is not the usual thing and I have
               never been there so late, but I must do so, Mama. I am going to give him a
                  <objectName type="letter">letter</objectName> in whioh I have told him 'goodbye,"'
               She said, "All right, then, if you must. I would get up and go with you, but I don't
               feel well enough," Mama often accompanied me on <eventName type="Mary'strips">my
                  trips</eventName>, which were not very many during the entire time that i knew
               him. So I went over there and arrived at <time type="11:55">five minutes to
                  twelve</time>, I am strange about that, I am rather queer about that, I think of
               the time; every time I was with him I would say, "Well, this time yesterday I didn't
               see him and today I am with him," and things like that. So I <time>arrived at five
                  minutes to twelve</time> and left at t<time type="12:40">twenty minutes to
                  one</time>, and-- Do you wish me to tell you all that transpired? </p>
            <p> DORAN: Never mind about that. </p>

            <p> DORAN: Your <persName key="grandmother" ref = "family" role = "family" >grandmother</persName> didn't accompany
               you?</p>

            <p> MINTER: No, she did not. </p>

            <p>DORAN: Your <persName key="chaffeur" ref="#servant" role = "business" >chauffeur</persName> drove you there? </p>

            <p>MINTER: No, I drove myself in my little <objectName type="car">car</objectName>,
               little run-about.</p>

            <p> DORAN: That was <date type="Dec23rd">December 23d</date>? </p>

            <p> MINTER: Yes,<date> December 23rd.</date></p>

            <p> DORAN: When was the last time you saw him prior to that? </p>

            <p> MINTER: I couldn't give you the exact date, but I know it was at <date>least three
                  months and a little over; it was over three months.</date></p>

            <p>DORAN: During the three months prior to December 23d, did you ever meet him
               anywhere.</p>

            <p> MINTER: No. You mean casually or see him really to talk to? I saw him, yes. </p>

            <p>DORAN: See him and meet him, to be with him? </p>
            <p>MINTER: No; no, indeed. I passed him at <placeName type="studio"> Lasky Studio
               </placeName> when I go over there. Sometimes I have seen <objectName type="vehicle"
                  >his car</objectName> go down <placeName type="street"> Western
                  Avenue,</placeName> but I hadn't seen him to speak to in <date
                  type="threemonthsago">three months</date>.</p>

            <p> DORAN: As I understand it, you were sincerely in love with him?</p>

            <p> MINTER: That is true.</p>

            <p> DORAN: Did you convey that feeling to him?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Absolutely.</p>

            <p> DORAN: You told him, did you?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Absolutely. He loved me; he told me so.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Were you engaged to be married?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, we were not.</p>

            <p> DORAN: <eventName type="timeofdeath">At the time of his death</eventName>, it was
               --</p>

            <p> MR. MOTT: Right there at that point you might explain about the rising sun, with
               reference to your engagement. I think that explains the attitude between both of you. </p>

            <p>MINTER: I don't know just which to do, whether to tell you this whole thing, go right
               along and talk. I can easily do that. </p>

            <p>MR. MOTT: He asked if you were engaged to him. Tell him about the "rising sun"
               explanation. </p>

            <p> MINTER: I can tell you the whole thing better without being asked.</p>

            <p> MR. DORAN: Yes. Go ahead. and tell us in your own way all about it.</p>

            <p> MINTER: I had always known that this was just<eventName> an exquisite chapter in my
                  life</eventName> that must necessarily be a brief one: I couldn't bear to part
               with it; it was just a beautiful thing that seldom occurs in the. world today as I
               see it, as it is forced upon me. It as simply a beautiful white flame; I met
                  <persName key="taylor">him</persName>; I had always been a <persName>reserved,
                  very retiring young girl</persName>, and he was the first man and the only man who
               ever embodied all the glories of manhood in one private body. He represented that to
               me. He never by look, by word or by deed gave me any reason to doubt any of my ideals
               that were placed in him absolutely. At the time our love first formulated he said to
               me, "Mary, this is not right. You are May and I am December, and this is not right. I
               know it is best that we must part." This was at the very beginning of it, and I said,
               "Of course, I don't want to do any immodest or bold thing; I couldn't try to withhold
               a person's love for me who didn't care for me."" I said, "I know that you are many
               years older than I, but I couldn't love anybody as I love you. I simply love you. And
               we did try to part, We tried it again and again, and then he would beoome ill. At one
               time I had almost resolved to see him no more, and he was taken ill and nobody else
               cared, [page 6] really cared whether he ate his <objectName>dinner</objectName> or
               whether he dressed warm1y enough, whether he took care of himself, and I couldn't
               bear for him to suffer. It was not only a love of sweetheart, but I wanted to be his
               nurse. I wanted to hold his head when it was aching. I wanted him to tell me his
               mental troubles, his heart troubles, and let me soothe them away for him as I would
               for a little child. I forgot the man's age; it meant nothing to me. The only thing I
               wanted was to serve him as I would have served the Lord or a little child, and then
               it just passed away; for months at a time I wouldn't see him and I didn't know why.
               Finally, I decided there was no use; it must come to an end and I went there on the
               night of the 23d to give him this letter telling him "goodbye." I had reason to
               believe, in the awful vernacular of the day, that it was over anyway, but I went
               there to say "goodbye" myself. He said, "It is rather late, isn't it, Mary?" when he
               opened the door. I said, "Yes, but don't you realize that I had to come to see you?
               You know Mama has been sick for three months and you have been ill and I have been
               frightfully worried and you haven't even had the kindness to call me to tell me that
               you were i11 and that I must not expect to see you to tell mo that things are all
               right." </p>

            <p> I said, "I don't care if you don't wish to see me, because it hurts me, but it
               wouldn't have hurt one-millionth as much if you had just explained to me and not
               leave me in the dark." He said, "Mary, I couldn't help it; I couldn't help it and I
               can't explain it to you." Oh, I don't know! I have told this thing so many times, Mr
               Doran, that the words just - I can't tell it even as it is; I can't even express it
               to you as it really is. There is so much more to it.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>MR DORAN: At that time, on <date type="Dec23rd">December 23d,</date> let's see, he
               was killed on <date ref="Feb1st">February 1st</date>. Who was directing you then? </p>
            <p>MINTER: Why, no one was. I had finished a picture.</p>

            <p> DORAN: Who directed the last one?</p>
