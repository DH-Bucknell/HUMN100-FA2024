               PM</p>

            <p> A. (Speaking of the morning following the murder) ** I was called on the
                  <objectName type="communication ">telephone</objectName>, I should judge at <time>8</time> by his
               assistant <persName ref="#director" role="buissness" key="harryFellows">Harry Fellows</persName>, and he told me. He said,
                  "<persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="eyton">Mr. Eyton</persName>, when I came over to <persName
                  key="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> room <date>this morning</date>, I
                  <eventName type="mortality">found him dead</eventName>." And I says, "Dead? What is the matter?" He
               says "Well, we have had a <persName role="unknown" ref="#professional" key="doctor">docto</persName> here and he tells
               us it is a <eventName type="illness">hemorhhage of the stomach</eventName>. **</p>

            <p>A. That would make it about <time>8:30</time>, I should judge.</p>
            <p> A. I didn't go through <placeName type="residency">the house</placeName>. <persName ref="#writer" role="buissness" key="maigne"
                  >Charley Maigne</persName> and <persName ref="#director" role="buissness" key="hoyt">Arthur Hoyt</persName> and
                  <persName key="dougMaclean">Douglas MacLean</persName> and <persName ref="#director" role="buissness" key="harryFellows">Harry
                  Fellows</persName>.</p>
            <p> A. ** <persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="dougMaclean">Douglas MacLean</persName> was the first man that put
               it into my head that he (<persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Taylor</persName>) <eventName type="mortality">was
                  murdered</eventName>. He said he was confident that he had <eventName type="murder">heard a
                  shot</eventName>
               <date>the night before</date>. He said to me, "<persName ref="#writer" role="buissness" key="maigne"
                  >Charley</persName>, don't let them take his body away with out turning it over,
               because I think we heard a <eventName type="murder">shot last night</eventName>."</p>

            <p> Q. Have you any idea who did the <eventName type="communication">telephoning</eventName> around about
                  <eventName>the murder</eventName>?</p>
            <p> A. No. <persName ref="#director" role="buissness" key="harryFellows">Harry Fellows</persName>
               <eventName type="communication">telephoned me</eventName>.</p>
            <p> Q. Did you hear anybody call up <persName role="romantic" ref="#actor" key="normand">Mabel Normand</persName> or
                  <persName role="unknown" ref="#family" key="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby</persName>?</p>
            <p>A. No. That all happened before I got there, if <persName role="unknown" ref="#family" key="cshelby">Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName> was called up. <persName role="unknown" ref="#actor" key="normand">Mabel Normand</persName>
               was called up, I know. <persName ref="#writer" role="buissness" key="maigne">Charley Maigne</persName> told me.</p>
            <p> Q. What was the position of the <objectName type="body">body</objectName> when you first saw
               it?</p>
            <p> A. <objectName type="body">The body</objectName> when I first saw it lay right <placeName type="location">in
                  front of the desk</placeName>, with the head back. <placeName type="location">The desk was near
                  his feet</placeName>.</p>

            <p> A. ** Of course <persName role="social" ref="#actor" key="mary">Mary</persName> was <eventName type="betroth">engaged to
                  marry</eventName>
               <persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="mickeyNeilan">Mickey Neilan</persName>, so she told me, but I don't think
               there was very much to that.</p>
            <p>Q. This trouble with <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Taylor</persName>, when was that?</p>
            <p> A. He and <persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="mickeyNeilan">Mickey</persName>? Oh, <persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="mickeyneilan"
                  >Mickey</persName> said something one night. They were drunk and
                  <persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="mickeyNeilan">Mickey</persName> apologized. It was nothing serious.</p>

            <p>Q. Do you know <persName ref="#actor" role="romantic" key="gerber">Neva Gerber</persName>?</p>
            <p> A. Yes. That was one of <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Taylor's</persName> former flames,
               before any of this came up.</p>
            <p> ** When he <eventName type="wartime">went to war</eventName> it was understood that when he came
               back he was going to <eventName type="betroth">marry</eventName>
               <persName  ref="#actor" role="romantic" key="gerber">Neva Gerber</persName>.</p>

            <p> NEIL HARRINGTON, Neighbor Statement taken 2-9-22</p>

            <p> POLICE: *** I understand you went over with <persName ref="#professional" role="unknown" key="dumas">Mr.
                  Dumas</persName>?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: I went in there first.</p>

            <p> POLICE: When you saw <persName ref="#director">Taylor</persName>
               <eventName type="positioning">lying out</eventName>
               <placeName type="location">on the floor</placeName>, why <objectName type="clothing">his clothing</objectName> was
               perfectly arranged, was it not?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: Perfectly arranged. I made the remark at the time, "I don't believe the
               man fell in that position." (Re man peeping in windows of <persName ref="#director" key="taylor"
                  >Taylor's</persName>
               <placeName type="residency">home</placeName> in <date>August, 1921</date>) Between <persName
                 ref="#director" key="taylor">Taylor's</persName> house and the garage, there is the
                  two windows, and <persName ref="#director" key="taylor"
               >Taylor</persName>‚Äôs house the window to the living room and the window to the
               kitchen - *** I saw <eventName type="suspisous">a man peeking in the curtain</eventName>, and as he
               saw me‚Äî this man, I believe I would recognize-- as he heard me he started and
               stopped naturally, rather frightened, and he didn't say a word, but whirled right
               around and <eventName type="movement">walked out</eventName>.</p>

            <p> POLICE: Do you know whether <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was there
               or not?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: There was a light in there, *** I should say probably along about the
                  <date>20th of August</date>.</p>

            <p> POLICE: How would you describe the <objectName type="bodyPart">fellow's face</objectName>?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: Rather a good looking fellow, good features. Of course I couldn't tell
               whether <objectName type="bodyPart">his face</objectName> was ruddy complexion --</p>

            <p> POLICE: Regular features?</p>

            <p>HARRINGTON: Yes, regular features. It wasn't <persName role="social" ref="#servant" key="peavey">Taylor's
                  chauffeur</persName> at that time.</p>

            <p> POLICE: About what time was it <time>in the evening</time>?</p>

            <p> HARRINGTON: Oh, somewhat around <time>9 o‚Äôclock</time>,<time> early in the
                  evening</time>.</p>

            <p>~~~~~</p>

            <p>CHARLES MAIGNE (Friend of Taylor) Statement taken 2-9-22</p>

            <p> MAIGNE: ** After I got over the shock of <eventName type="mortality">Bill's
                  death</eventName>, was wondering how on earth <persName ref="#director" key="taylor"
                  >Bill</persName> could have fallen the way he did. The position that <persName
                  ref="#director" key="taylor">Bill</persName> was in stumped me for two solid days *** If he had
               been sitting in his chair and <eventName type="murder">had been shot</eventName>, or if he
                  <eventName type="murder">had been shot</eventName> in <objectName type="bodyPart">his back</objectName> with his
               back to the door, he was lying stretched out with his <placeName type="positoning">feet towards the
                  door</placeName>, <objectName type="bodyPart">hands</objectName> by his side. There was no
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">blood</objectName> anywhere except directly under <objectName type="bodyPart">his
                  head</objectName> where <objectName type="bodyPart">the blood</objectName> had run out of
                  <objectName type="bodyPart">his mouth</objectName> from the hemorrhage and a little bit directly
               under where the wound in the back was.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Was the <objectName type="clothing">clothing</objectName> all properly arranged?</p>

            <p>MAIGNE: <objectName type="clothing">Clothing</objectName> all <eventName type="positioning">properly
                  arranged</eventName>. (Speaking of the condition of the room when he first saw
                  it<date> the morning after the murder</date>)</p>

            <p>WINN: There were also papers on <objectName type="furniture">the
                  couch</objectName>? *** I know when you came up there about <time> 9:15 or
                  9:30</time>.</p>

            <p>MAIGNE: <time>Around 9:30 or 10 o'clock</time>. **** Before we had been there a half
               or three-quarters of an hour, I noticed <objectName type="money">three or four checks</objectName>
               on the floor alongside of <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Bill</persName>,
                  <objectName type="money">cancelled checks</objectName>. They were <placeName type="location">not on the
                  floor</placeName> when I came in. This pile of <objectName type="money">cancelled
                  checks</objectName> was almost smooth and level right on <objectName type="furniture">his
                  desk</objectName>, just as though he had been interrupted in his work and nobody
               had touched them. ** On <date>the night after</date>
               <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Taylor</persName> was <eventName type="murder">killed</eventName>
               <eventName type="communication">I called up</eventName>
               <persName ref="#servant" role="social" key="tiffany">Earl Tiffany</persName> and had him come up to <placeName type="house">the
                  house</placeName>. *** His wife came up with him *** The first thing he told me
               was that his wife had positively seen <persName role="social" ref="#servant" key="sands">Sands</persName> at the
               corner of <placeName type="street">Fifth and Figueroa</placeName>, I think it was, at <time>1:15
                  PM</time> on the day before <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Taylor</persName> was murdered.
               She had known <persName ref="#servant" key="sands">Sands</persName> and <persName ref="#servant" role="social" key="tiffany"
                  >Tiffany</persName> before she married <persName ref="#servant" role="social" key="tiffany">
               Tiffany</persName>.</p>

            <p> MAIGNE: It must have been about half past <time>7 in the morning</time> of the day
               that <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Bill</persName>was killed that <persName ref="#servant" role="unknown" key="maid">Miss
                  Normand's maid</persName> came over and wanted to see me right away. *** I hurried
               over and <persName ref="#actor" role="romantic" key="normand">Mabel</persName> told me that <persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="purviance"
                  >Edna Purviance</persName> had <eventName type="communication">telephoned to her</eventName> that
                  <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Bill</persName> had been found dead. *** and
                  <persName ref="#actor" role="romantic" key="normand">Mabel</persName> ** asked me to go up there, and I think there were only
               two or three people here when I got in. It must have been approximately <time>8
                  o'clock</time>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: About what time was that that you got there?</p>

            <p> MAIGNE: About <time>8 or 8:30</time>, I should say.The man in the corner court, just
               beyond <persName ref="#actor" role="buissness" key="purviance">Miss Purviance</persName>, on the same side
                  <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Bill</persName>was on, he said he was reading an <objectName type="documents">Evening
                  Herald</objectName> and heard the conversation between <persName ref="#actor" role="romantic" key="normand">Miss
                  Normand</persName> and <persName ref="#director" key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName>, and heard them say, "Good
               night", and then the footsteps going back, and then immediately the whirr of the
               motor, and she had gone and the footsteps died out, and he <eventName type="murder">heard the
                  shot</eventName>. </p>
