            <p>NANCE: There was no other disturbance there?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: No, sir. Even the <placeName type="house">living-room</placeName> <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> that I had moved aside. The <objectName type="furniture">rocking chair</objectName>
               would hit the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName>, and I moved the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> so the <objectName type="furniture">rocking chair</objectName> would not hit the

            <p>PEAVEY: No sir, we had those little long <objectName type="decoration">pins</objectName> that runs in the <objectName type="passage">windows</objectName>. The <objectName type="passage">windows</objectName>
               <placeName type="wing">upstairs</placeName> in <persName key="taylor">his</persName> <placeName type="house">bedroom</placeName> were up. The <objectName type="passage">windows</objectName> downstairs I always locked with this peg
               that slipped in the <objectName type="passage">window</objectName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE: Were they still that way in the <time>morning</time>?</p>

            <p>PEAVEY: They were still that way in the <time>morning</time>. The <objectName type="lighting">lights</objectName> were burning just as I
               had left them <time>that night</time>; <objectName type="lighting">two lights</objectName>, one in the <placeName type="house">living-room</placeName> and one in the
               <placeName type="house">dining-room</placeName>.</p>

            <p>NANCE:That is all, you may be excused.</p>

            <p>I hereby certify that I, as shorthand reporter, correctly took down in shorthand the
               testimony and proceedings had at the within named Coroner's inquest; that the
               foregoing is a full, true and correct copy of my shorthand notes and a full, true and
               correct statement of the testimony and pro- ceedings had at said inquest. E.M. Allen,
               Shorthand Reporter</p>
