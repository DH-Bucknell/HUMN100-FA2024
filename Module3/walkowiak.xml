            <head>Interview with Charlotte Shelby</head>
            <byline>Emma Walkowiak</byline>


            <p> December 26, 1929</p>
            <p>A. M. Rochlen</p>
            <p>LOS ANGELES EXAMINER</p>

            <p> In a remarkable interview, given exclusively to the <orgName type="publishing">LOS
                  ANGELES EXAMINER</orgName>, <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social"
                  >Mrs. Charlotte Shelby</persName>, mother of <persName key="minter" ref="#actor"
                  role="business">Mary Miles Minter</persName>, <time>last night</time> for the
               first time revealed hitherto unknown phases of the <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">William Desmond Taylor</persName> murder case.</p>

            <p> From the wealth of memories so closely associated with the career of her talented
               daughter she brought forth details that shed a new light on the many investigations
               that sought to unravel the tangled threads of the murder of the film director -- a
               case famous the world over.</p>
            <p>(continued below) </p>
            <p> "Perhaps she went to dinner at <placeName type="residence">someone's
                  house</placeName>, it was suggested to me. We tried to reassure ourselves of this,
               but somehow I kept worrying about getting no telephone call and about that
                  <objectName type="vehicle">big, fast car</objectName> and the <placeName
                  type="road">foggy roads</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "We began to call up persons at the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>. We
               called the <persName key="camera crew" ref="#studio_employee" role="business"
                  >cameraman</persName> and the <persName key="camera crew" ref="#studio_employee" role="business"
                  >assistant cameraman</persName>. The <persName key="camera crew" 
                     ref="#studio_employee" role="business">cameraman</persName>, a big, jolly Irishman, was a favorite
               of <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Mary's</persName>. He was married and had
               small children. She was fond of children and occasionally stopped at <placeName
                  type="residence">his house</placeName>. The <persName key="camera crew"
                     ref="#studio_employee" role="business">cameraman</persName> told us <persName key="minter"
                        ref="#actor" role="business">Mary</persName> had not been there. No one could remember seeing her
               leave the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "We thought <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> perhaps
               would know. But we did not have his phone number. No one seemed to know it. </p>
            <p> "Then we remembered that <time>one day</time>
               <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Mary</persName> and her grandmother, <persName
                  key="miles" ref="#family">Juliette B. Miles</persName>, went to <placeName
                  type="residence"><persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor's</persName>
                  home</placeName> for <eventName type="tea">tea</eventName>. </p>
            <p> "<persName key="chauncey" ref="#servant" role="business">Chauncey</persName>, our chauffeur, drove
               them, so we called <persName key="chauncey" ref="#servant" role="business">Chauncey</persName> and
               asked him if he knew where <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> lived. He said he thought he could find <placeName
                  type="residence">the place</placeName> but did not know the address. </p>
            <p> "So we started out, <persName key="chauncey" ref="#servant" role="business">Chauncey</persName>, my
               secretary and <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">I</persName>. </p>
            <p> "We <eventName type="driving">drove around</eventName> and around. the chauffeur
               said he knew <placeName type="neighborhood">the neighborhood</placeName> but was not
               certain of the exact location. Finally he remembered it. We stopped at the <placeName
                  type="residence">corner of Fourth and Alvarado streets</placeName>. It was
                  <time>close to midnight</time> then. </p>
            <p> "<persName key="chauncey" ref="#servant" role="business">Chauncey</persName> said he did not know
               which <placeName type="residence">bungalow</placeName> was <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">Mr. Taylor's</persName>. There were a number of them," <persName
                  key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> went on, making a wide sweep
               with her <objectName type="bodyPart">right arm</objectName>. "As I remember it, there
               were <placeName type="location">some on the left, some on the right and some
                  bungalows in the back</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "I saw a <objectName type="lighting">light</objectName> burning in a <placeName
                  type="house">window on the right</placeName>, so I rang the <objectName
                  type="doorbell">bell</objectName>, or knocked, I don't remember which. Some one
               answered and I asked them if they knew where <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                  >Mr. Taylor</persName> lived. They pointed to <placeName type="residence">a house
                  on the left side of the court, the last one in the back</placeName>. I went there
               and rang the <objectName type="doorbell">bell</objectName>. <placeName
                  type="residence">The house</placeName> was dark. </p>
            <p> "<persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor's</persName> voice came from the
                  <placeName type="residence">second story window</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "'Who is there?' he asked." </p>
            <p> "'This is <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName>,<persName
                  key="taylor" ref="#director"> Mr. Taylor</persName>,' I answered. </p>
            <p> "'I'll be right down,' he replied and in a short time opened the door and asked me
               to step in. </p>
            <p> "I entered the room, a sort of combination living and dining room. <persName
                  key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> showed much interest. He, too,
               appeared worried over <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Mary</persName>'s absence.
               Then he suggested some more persons to call. I waited while he used the <objectName
                  type="communication">telephone</objectName>. </p>
            <p> "I remember that he stepped into a sort of <placeName type="residence">a telephone
                  room -- an out of the way nook</placeName>, and called. He talked to an assistant
               director, I think his name was <persName key="o'connor" ref="#director" role="business">Frank
                  O'Connor</persName>, and he called several others. None had seen <persName
                  key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Mary</persName> or knew where she had gone. </p>
            <p> "By this time we both were considerably worried. </p>
            <p> "After some conversation, in which I mentioned my fears of an accident, I left." </p>
            <p> "'Be sure to call me and let me know if anything had happened,'<persName
                  key="taylor" ref="#director"> Mr. Taylor</persName> said as he bade me goodbye. I
               went to <placeName type="vehicle">our car</placeName>, where <persName key="whitney"
                  ref="#professional" role="unknown">Charlotte Whitney, the secretary</persName>, waited for me,
               and we went <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "I do not now remember the time of this visit. It was not, as has been whispered
               around, <time>shortly before <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr.
                     Taylor's</persName> murder</time>. I did not 'storm' into <placeName
                  type="residence">the house</placeName>, with a <objectName type="gun">loaded
                  revolver</objectName> in hand, as has been whispered around. I did not threaten
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName>, as has been said." </p>
            <p>
               <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Miss Minter</persName>, <persName key="cshelby"
                  ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> said, <time>came home some time later</time>. </p>
            <p> "She never told us where she had been <time>that night</time>. We were relieved to
               learn that there had been no accident and that she was well. </p>
            <p> "But months later we learned about that trip. <persName key="urson" ref="#family" role="unknown"
                  >Frank Urson</persName>, a dear friend of the family, and an old associate from
               Santa Barbara days, told me that he had run across <persName key="minter"
                  ref="#actor" role="business">Mary</persName>, driving her <objectName type="vehicle">big
                  roadster</objectName> at 55 miles an hour and that he took her in tow and finally
               sent her <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>. He told me he feared she would
               meet with an accident and warned us against her habit of speeding. </p>
            <p> "Certainly," <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> declared,
               "this incident is not a hot murder mystery clue. Certainly, had there been anything
               sinister in <time>that night</time> visit, I would not have taken two witnesses me or
               made public inquiry for <placeName type="residence"><persName key="taylor"
                     ref="#director">Mr. Taylor's</persName> residence</placeName>. </p>
            <p> "And yet," <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> went on,"
               some one related this story and some one has been keeping it alive, until today it is
               one of the endless chains of clues and rumors that keep bobbing up on the least
               provocation. </p>
            <p> "What's more," <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName>
               declared, this story, along with all sorts of others, was related to former District
               Attorney <persName key="keyes" ref="#legal" role="unknown">Asa Keyes</persName>. </p>
            <p> "I made a complete statement to <persName key="keyes" ref="#legal" role="unknown">Mr.
                  Keyes</persName> after he returned from <placeName type="state">New
                  York</placeName>. I held back nothing. Why this 'mystery' should be resurrected
               ever so often, is beyond me." </p>
            <p> "To the world in general the <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                  >Taylor</persName> murder case brought thrills, mystery and the glamour of big
               names, but to others it brought tragedy and sorrow," she said. </p>
            <p> There was a long pause. </p>
            <p> Perhaps the hectic days of the first <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                  >Taylor</persName> case investigation were ringing through<persName key="cshelby"
                     ref="#family" role="social"> Mrs. Shelby's</persName> mind. Perhaps there came a train of
               thought that carried swiftly the amazing story of <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business"
                  >Mary's</persName> rise and the events that followed her famous director's
               unexplained murder. </p>
            <p> If <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> thought about the
                  <eventName type="lawsuit"><objectName type="money">$1,000,000</objectName> suit
                  filed by her daughter in <time>1926</time> and of her demand for accountings, for
                  audits and for return of <objectName type="money">money</objectName> earned in the
                  films</eventName>, she gave no indication of this. </p>
            <p> And if the drama of that <eventName type="bodyViewing">intense recital of <persName

                  few minutes before</time>, took her back to memories tinged with the romance of
               her beautiful daughter, <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby
               </persName>managed to hide her emotions. </p>
            <p> Earlier in the interview some allusion was made to <persName key="minter"
                  ref="#actor" role="business">Mary Miles Minter's</persName> glowing account of the slain director
               and to the love letters and tokens, most of them unidentified, found <placeName
                  type="residence">in his apartment</placeName>
               <time>after the murder</time>. </p>
            <p> "I'm sure, <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> was a
               gentleman," <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> said. </p>
            <p> She hesitated a little, and then went on. </p>
            <p> "I'm going to rip all this innuendo wide open -- there is no other way," she went
               on. </p>
            <p> "I know that there have been reports that I was in love with <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName> and that I was jealous of my daughter and
               also feared that <persName key="minter" ref="#family" role="business">Mary's </persName>career would
               suffer, and that I killed <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> to
               preserve my love and <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Mary's</persName> film
               future. </p>
            <p> "I am repeating these things just to show the absurdity of them. How is it possible
               to have such a double motive? The mere repetition of it shows the absurdity of the
               whole thing. Killing <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr. Taylor
               </persName>would have wrecked <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Mary's</persName>
               career instead of saving it. </p>
            <p> "But aside from that, the whole thing is ridiculous -- and vicious. </p>
            <p> "I am a woman who has always stood alone. </p>
            <p> "I was not in love with <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">William Desmond
                  Taylor</persName>. I was not in love with anyone. And no one was in love with me.
               I never held a purely social conversation with <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                  >Mr. Taylor</persName> in my life. He was always aloof, a man of mystery,
               polished, distant and reserved. </p>
            <p> "In <time>those days</time> my tasks and interests were few. I lived, talked,
               planned and worked only for <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="business">Mary</persName> and
               her pictures. </p>
            <p> "How utterly ridiculous, how unjust and criminal, to cast accusations of such flimsy
               nature, merely on 'clues' of such thin stuff. A crime without a motive, or reason." </p>
            <p>
               <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby's</persName> keyerences to
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> were most impersonal. In
               fact, she said during the interview, <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                  >Taylor</persName> himself was impersonal. </p>
            <p> She came back to the <date>night of February 1, 1922</date>, when <persName
                  key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> was shot and killed <time>only a
                  few minutes after the vivacious <persName key="normand" ref="#actor" role="romantic">Mabel
                     Normand</persName>, his dinner guest <time>that night</time>, left</time>
               <placeName type="residence">the bungalow</placeName> of the man she, along with many
               others, admired. </p>
            <p> She talked of <persName key="sands" ref="#servant" role="business">Sands -- Edward F.
                  Sands</persName>, the butler-valet of the slain director who <eventName
                  type="robbery">robbed and flaunted his employer</eventName> because he knew of his
               checkered past. </p>
            <p> Of the incidents leading up to and following the actual slaying of <persName
                  key="taylor" ref="#director">"Bill" Taylor</persName>, <persName key="cshelby"
                     ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> said but little. She keyused to express an
               opinion. And of <persName key="peavey" ref="#servant" role="business">Henry Peavey</persName>, the
               colored house boy and cook, who <eventName type="dinner">served dinner</eventName> on
                  <time>the night of the murder</time> and <time>left just before <persName
                     key="normand" ref="#actor" role="romantic">Miss Normand</persName></time>, <persName
                        key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> also had little to say. </p>
            <p> "I do not remember seeing him at the <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
                  >Taylor</persName> bungalow the night I called to see <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">Mr. Taylor</persName>," was all she said. </p>
            <p> "But this point seems to be overlooked generally when these vicious whispers are
               passed about," <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby</persName> added. </p>
            <p> "The <time>time of the murder</time> was pretty well fixed. <persName key="maclean"
                  ref="#professional" role="social">Mrs. Douglas MacLean</persName>, who <eventName type="gunshot"

                  <persName key="unidentified man" ref="#professional" role="unknown">this man</persName> and
               described <persName key="unidentified man" ref="#professional" role="unknown">him</persName>. </p>
            <p> "Do I answer that description?" <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs.
                  Shelby</persName> said smilingly as she rose to her feet and held out her
                  <objectName type="clothing">silk-encased arms</objectName>. </p>
            <p> "Dressed in <objectName type="clothing">men's clothes</objectName>? But why" Why
               would a woman run the extra risk of being detected by wearing <objectName
                  type="clothing">clothes</objectName> in which she at once would become
               conspicuous? </p>
            <p> "This whole affair, however, is far from a jest to us. As I have said before, I have
               made complete statements and stand ready to make them if needed and if they can be of
               any use. </p>
            <p> "But I will not remain idle and be a target. From now on I am going to seek out
               those who circulate these rumors. </p>
            <p> "I am back in <placeName type="state">California</placeName>, the land I love. I am
               not in seclusion, as has been printed, nor am I hiding from any one or anything.
               There are some things that I must reserve for the future. Some of them may hold the
               solution to the motive for the circulation of these cruel rumors." </p>
            <p>
               <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">Mrs. Shelby </persName>rose to bid her
               interviewer good-by. </p>
            <p> "You may add," she said smilingly, "that I will remain <placeName type="residence"
                  >right here</placeName> and that if I do move from this <placeName
