            <p>STATEMENT OF <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">MISS MARY
                  MILES MINTER</persName>. <persName key="boone" ref="#writer">G.H BOONE</persName>
               OFFICIAL REPORTER IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, <date>February 7, 1922</date>,
               at <time>five o'clock P.M.</time> [Part 5]</p>

            <p>DORAN: This was the second time that <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">he</persName> had declared love for you. On one occasion <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> proposed to <persName
                  key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">you</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">He</persName> asked
                  <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">you</persName> to
               marry <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">him</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, and then <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >he</persName> would dart away again. I mean <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> would call me up -- <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">He</persName> can't call me up,
               because I have no telephone; <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >he</persName> would send me <objectName type="decoration">flowers</objectName>,
               too, and suddenly I would not hear from <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">him</persName> for <time>two or three weeks</time>. As I said to
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">him</persName> in the
                  <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>, not particularly about that but about
               other things, about <eventName type="love">dinner engagements</eventName>, about
               appointments, I said, "You know, <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">Marshall</persName>, I never know when l am going to see <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">you</persName> and when I am not
               going to see <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">you</persName>,
               and just what <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">you</persName>
               are going to do, and I am in no mood to go on like that at all; I don't care much
               about it."</p>

            <p>DORAN: When did <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business"
                  >you</persName> tell <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName> that?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I told <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">him</persName>
               that when we were driving the <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: How old a <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >man</persName> is <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">Marshall
                  Neilan</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Just thirty.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Has <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> ever
               been <eventName type="marriage">married</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> has
               been married once for <time>a few days</time>. <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">He</persName> remained married to <persName key="neilanWife">his
                  wife</persName> for a long time, for <time>seven years</time>, I think, but
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> was actually
               only married a few days. I think <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">he</persName> married when <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">he</persName> was twenty or nineteen.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Have <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business"
                  >you</persName> seen <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName> since <time>this Friday night</time>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, I have not.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Have you talked with <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName> over the <objectName type="communication"
               >telephone</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: It was really <time>Saturday morning</time>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Has <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName>
               called you up on the <objectName type="communication">telephone</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> may
               have called me at the <placeName type="residence">New Hampshire house</placeName> and
               I wouldn't know.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">You</persName>
               haven't talked with <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName> over the <objectName type="communication"
               >telephone</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I haven't seen <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName> or talked to <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">him</persName> or come in touch with <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">him</persName> in any way</p>

            <p>DORAN: You haven't received any <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> from
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">him</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did you part friendly or unfriendly?</p>

            <p>MINTER: We did part more or less friendly, as I always did with <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">Marshall</persName>, no matter how
               angry I would become with <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName>, somehow you can't bear malice against that <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">boy</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">You</persName>
               have become angry with <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName> on <date>other occasions</date>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes. This night for the time being, I was furious [missing page] [...]
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">Mr Neilan</persName> --
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor's</persName>, and at the time of
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr Taylor</persName>'s <eventName
                  type="murder">death</eventName>, <persName key="harry" ref="#director"
                  >Harry</persName> was the assistant director in <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">Mr Taylor's</persName>
               <orgName type="company">companies</orgName> there, and he had said <persName
                  key="harry" ref="#director" role="business">Harry</persName> had been in
                  <placeName type="room">the room</placeName> looking over the effects -- Just a
               minute. I wonder if <persName key="maigne" ref="#director">Charles Maigne</persName>
               told me this. I think <persName key="neilan">Mr Neilan</persName> told me this, too,
               that <persName key="harry" ref="#director">Harry</persName> bad gotten the
                  <objectName type="document">letters</objectName> and taken <objectName

                  role="business">the camera man</persName>, whereupon I remarked, "I will bet
                  <persName key="ivers" ref="writer" role="unknown">Mrs Ivers</persName> had them,"
               and I think <persName key="vantrees" ref="#studio_employee" role="business"
                  >he</persName> said, "<persName key="vantrees" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >Jim</persName> gave <objectName type="document">them</objectName> to <persName
                  key="eyton" ref="#director" role="business">Mr Eyton</persName>," and that
                  <persName key="eyton" ref="#director" role="business">Mr Eyton</persName> turned
               some of <objectName type="document">them</objectName> over to the <persName
                  key="examiner" ref="#professional" role="unknown">Examiner</persName>. I am so
               afraid l am telling things that are not so here, <persName key="doran" ref="#writer"
                  role="unknown">Mr Doran</persName>; I don't mean to, but I couldn't get all of it.
               That is as clear as I can make it. Anyway, I do remember this part, <persName
                  key="eyton" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> said <persName
                  key="eyton" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> heard about <objectName
                  type="document">them</objectName>, and I don't know how <persName key="eyton"
                  ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> heard about <objectName
                  type="document">them</objectName>, and that <persName key="eyton" ref="#director"
                  role="business">he</persName> went down, I believe, to the <persName
                  key="examiner" ref="#professional" role="unknown">Examiner</persName>, to get
               ahold of <objectName type="document">them</objectName> and <persName key="eyton"
                  ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> had something to do with <placeName
                  type="city">Pasadena</placeName>, a man, he did tell me the man's name. I don't
               remember his name, but I believe it be­gan with "S", and this <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">man</persName>, <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">Marshall</persName> said he was the <persName

                  <orgName type="group">Examiner force</orgName>, told <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">him</persName> to go down and take the <objectName

               remember, <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">Marshall</persName>
               said, "I then sent <objectName type="document">them</objectName> to the <placeName
                  type="studio">Realart Studio</placeName> and they ought to be in <persName
                  key="charley" ref="#studio_employee" role="unknown">Charley</persName>'s hands now
               or <persName key="garbut" ref="#studio_employee" role="unknown">Mr
               Garbut</persName>." This whole <time>Friday night</time> is most hasy in my
               recollection.</p>

            <p>DORAN: This <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">man</persName>
               knew before <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business"
                  >you</persName> were in love with <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr
                  Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Oh, yes.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">You</persName>
               had told <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">him</persName> that,
               had <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">you</persName>
               not?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; in fact, I had never said to <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">Marshall</persName> "<persName key="minter" ref="#director"
                  >I</persName> am in love with <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">William
                  Desmond Taylor</persName>." I never had.</p>

            <p>DORAN: How did <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName>
               find it out, then?</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">He</persName> knew
               about it, because we had been friends a long time. Before this <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">Marshall</persName> had come to <placeName
                  type="residence">my house</placeName> very despondent and said, "I think <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">I</persName> will go out in
                  <placeName type="landscape">the garden</placeName> and eat wooly worms." I said,
               "Don't feel that way; there are plenty of us who feel the same way." I am certain
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> knew about
                  <eventName type="love">this thing</eventName>. I made no secret of <eventName
                  type="love">it</eventName>, but I didn't promenade it about.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Don't <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business"
                  >you</persName> have a recollection of having told <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">him</persName>, <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">Marshall Neilan</persName>, that you were fond of
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No. Many times I said, "I admire <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr
                  Taylor</persName>; I respect <persName key="taylor" ref="#director"
               >him</persName>; <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >you</persName> know I respect his opinion; what a <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">wonderful man</persName> I consider <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">him</persName> to be." <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">He</persName> knew I regarded <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">him</persName> most highly.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Do you remember if <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >he</persName> asked you at the time <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">he</persName>
               <eventName type="love">pro­posed</eventName> to you if you were in love with any one
               else?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName>
               didn't ask me that at all.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did you have any admirers who might have been jealous of <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">him</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: There was only one possible <persName key="dickson" role="unknown"
                  >admirer</persName>, and that was <persName key="dickson" role="unknown">Mr
                  Dickson</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Any besides <persName key="dickson" role="unknown">Mr Dickson</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; in fact, if I may say so, neither <persName key="dickson" role="unknown"
                  >Mr Dickson</persName> nor <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >Mr Neilan</persName> has been with me constantly enough, or I feel really care
               enough for me to do any such thing in my behalf, I mean such as <eventName
                  type="murder">commit murder</eventName>. In my own mind I am absolutely convinced
               that I know they would not.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">You</persName>
               think they are incapable, in other words?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I absolutely do.</p>

            <p>DORAN: What kind of <objectName key="cigarette">cigarettes</objectName> was <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">Neilan</persName> smoking <time>the
                  night</time> at the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">He</persName> smokes
               two kinds of <objectName type="posession">cigarettes</objectName>. <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">He</persName> smokes a gold tipped
               called <objectName type="posession">"Dimi"</objectName> something from <placeName
                  type="country">Egypt</placeName>, I forget the name, <objectName type="posession"
                  >"D" something</objectName>; I noticed <objectName type="posession"
                  >it</objectName> comes from <placeName type="city">Cairo</placeName>; then
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> smokes
                  <objectName type="posession">Chesterfield cigarettes</objectName>. At least, I
               have seen <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">him</persName>
               smoking <objectName type="posession">Chesterfield cigarettes</objectName>. I remember
               that much, because I have always admired the face of the <objectName
                  type="advertisement">Chesterfield boy</objectName> on that <objectName
                  type="advertisement">red back sign</objectName>, you know, that <objectName
                  type="advertisement">laughing boy</objectName> in the light hair that says, "Gee"!
                  <objectName type="posession">They</objectName> satisfy!"</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">Neilan</persName>
               take <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">you</persName> home
               then <time>that morning</time> from the <placeName type="studio">studio</placeName>
               or did <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">you</persName> go
               back in <placeName type="vehicle">your own car</placeName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No; my <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> had been driven back to
               its <placeName type="house">garage</placeName> by <persName key="chauffeur"
                  role="unknown">Mr Neilan's chauffeur</persName> with my <persName
                  key="scarborough" role="unknown">friend</persName>
               <persName key="scarborough" role="unknown">Mr Scarborough</persName> in it. Poor
                  <persName key="scarborough" role="unknown">Mr Scarborough</persName> had been
               driving around with me <time>all evening</time>. I hadn't been able to sleep and that
               was why I ws_ out. <persName key="scarborough" role="unknown">He</persName> said if I
               didn't mind <persName key="scarborough" role="unknown">he</persName> would just go on
               back home, now that I was in safe hands, and get some sleep. <persName
                  key="scarborough" role="unknown">He</persName> was pretty near dead tired.
                  <persName key="scarborough" role="unknown">He</persName> isn't a very strong
               man.</p>

            <p>DORAN: So <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">Neilan</persName>
               took <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">you</persName>
               <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> then</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; right straight <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> ask
               you to keep in confidence the <eventName type="conversation">conversation</eventName>
               you had had with <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName>? Did <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >he</persName> tell you not to say anything about <eventName type="conversation"
                  >it</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: l don't remember <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >him</persName> saying to me, "You must keep this all in secret oonfidenoe"; no, I
               do not, because when we got <placeName type="residence">home</placeName> we discussed
               some of the things with <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social"
                  >mother</persName>, with the whole family, in fact; <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> discussed the seriousness of the
                  <eventName type="conversation">conversation</eventName> and told me not to do
               anything without my <persName key="legal" ref="#legal" role="unknown"
                  >at­torneys</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">He</persName> told you
                  <eventName type="conversation">that</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName>
               said, "<persName>You</persName> mustn't make any move without your <persName
                  key="legal" ref="#legal" role="unknown">attorneys</persName>." <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">He</persName> spoke of <persName
                  key="mott" role="unknown">Mr Mott</persName> and said <persName key="mott"
                  role="unknown">Mr Mott</persName> was very able and that <persName key="mott"
                  >he</persName> would tell me the right thing to do and not to <eventName
                  type="legal">make a move</eventName> without <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">him</persName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business"
                  >you</persName> comment on <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >his</persName> concern?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Did <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business"
                  >you</persName> say anything to <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">him</persName>, for instance to this effect: "Why should <persName
                  key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">you</persName> be so concerned about
                  <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">me</persName>? Why
               should <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">I</persName>
               consult <persName key="legal" ref="#legal">attorneys</persName> in connection with
                  <eventName type="legal">this affair</eventName>?" or anything like that?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No, I did not, because at the time, when I asked <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">him</persName> if <persName key="neilan"
                  ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> suspected me of <eventName
                  type="murder">killing</eventName>
               <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Mr Taylor</persName>, we had that out;
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> assured me
                  <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> didn't
               suspect any such thing, but <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business"
                  >he</persName> was very much impressed with the gravity of the situation. In fact,
               evidently <persName key="neilan" ref="#director" role="business">he</persName> knew
               at that time exactly how these things were going to turn out. I mean that they would
               drag everybody's name into it; that the <orgName type="publishing">papers</orgName>
               could get hold of for the notoriety of it. <persName key="neilan" ref="#director"
                  role="business">He</persName> said, "This involves <orgName type="job">picture
                  people</orgName> and you know how <persName key="hearst" role="business"
                  >Hearst</persName> hates the <orgName type="job">picture people</orgName>.
                  <persName key="hearst" role="business">Hearst</persName> would do anything
                  <persName key="hearst">he</persName> could if <persName key="hearst"
                  role="business">he</persName> thought you did know <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">Mr Taylor</persName>," "There are lots of prominent people in the

                  >him</persName>. They are certainly going to drag your name into it."</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">You</persName>
               didn't <eventName type="conversation">telephone</eventName>
               <persName key="taylor" ref="#director">Taylor</persName> on <eventName type="murder"
                  >the night he was murdered</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: No.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Where did <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business"
                  >you</persName> happen to be <eventName type="murder">that night</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: I was at home reading the <objectName type="posession">Cruise of the
                  Kewa</objectName>. It is a <objectName type="posession">humorous
               book</objectName>; it is really a travesty of <objectName type="posession">Frederick
                  O'Brien's stories</objectName> of the South Seas. It is very funny, and I laid
               there laughing all the <time>evening</time>. I was very -- right while I was laying
               on the <objectName type="furniture">couch</objectName> reading aloud to <persName
                  key="cshelby" ref="#family" role="social">mother</persName> and sister and we were
               all laughing heartily at that time, and at the same time <persName key="taylor"
                  ref="#director">Mr Taylor</persName> was <eventName type="murder">being
                  murdered</eventName>. It seems very horrible to me.</p>

            <p>DORAN: <persName key="minter" ref="#actor" role="romantic business">You</persName>
               had no company at <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>
               <eventName type="murder">that night</eventName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Let me see. I don't remember any. Possibly <persName key="stockdale"
                  role="unknown">Mr Stockdale</persName>, he generally did, or maybe somebody
               dropped in. I don't just remember. Usually every evening somebody drops in. I know
               they were not there at the time I was reading <objectName type="lit">the
                  book</objectName>.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Your <objectName type="vehicle">automobiles</objectName> were all <placeName
                  type="residence">home</placeName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes, unless I put my <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> in the
                  <placeName type="house">garage</placeName> called the <placeName type="business"
                  >Standard Garage</placeName>. I leave it there sometimes, the <placeName
                  type="business">Standard Garage</placeName> on <placeName type="street">Hollywood
                  Boulevard and Western Avenue</placeName>. Sometimes when my girl friends stop with
               me and have her <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName>, I would move out and put
               it in this <placeName type="house">garage</placeName> and maybe wouldn't call for it
               for <time>several days</time>. I haven't been feeling well for some time; I have had
               bronchitis. I hadn't gotten well when this awful shock came to me, and I haven't used
               the little <objectName type="vehicle">car</objectName> very much.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Do you have a <persName key="chaucy" ref="#servant" role="unknown"
                  >chauffeur</persName>?</p>

            <p>MINTER: Yes; faithful old <persName key="chaucy" ref="#servant" role="unknown"
                  >Chauncy</persName>. <persName key="chaucy" ref="#professional" role="unknown"
                  >Chauncy</persName> is just as concerned about this thing as <persName
                  key="cshelby" role="social">my mother</persName> is.</p>

            <p>DORAN: Well, I don't think of anything else I care to inquire about now.</p>

            <p>MINTER: <persName key="doran" ref="#writer" role="unknown">Mr Doran</persName>, if I
               can be of any possible help in any way, it is true I don't know any more than I have
               told you; if I can, please call on me the first thing, won't you?</p>

            <p>DORAN: Thank you, very much. You may think of little things of which you may not
               appreciate the imporance, <persName key="mott" role="unknown">Mr Mott</persName>.</p>

            <p>MINTER: As I told <persName key="mott" role="unknown">Mr Mott</persName> today, I
               remember saying to <persName key="mott" role="unknown">Mr Mott</persName>, "I am so
               tired I am like a little child. I speak words mechanically. I sit, sleep, get up,
               walk and dress, and I don't see exactly what I am doing."</p>
