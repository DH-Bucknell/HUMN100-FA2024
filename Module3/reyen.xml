            <p><persName key="jewett">CHRISTINA JEWETT</persName>, maid for <persName key="faithMaclean">Mrs. MacLean</persName>
               Statement taken 2-9-22 </p>

            <p>(Witness after explaining that she was waiting between the service of courses to the
                  <persName key="macleans">MacLeans</persName>, states as follows) </p>

            <p>JEWETT: While I was waiting there I heard <persName key="murderer">a man</persName> come from the
                  <placeName type= "street">corner</placeName> and go down in the <placeName type="passage">alley</placeName> and
                  <persName key="murderer">he</persName> stopped right near against a big
                  <objectName type="yard">fence</objectName> there in the <placeName type="passage">alley</placeName>, and it
               seems to me <persName key="murderer">he</persName> stopped just between the
                  <placeName type="house">garage</placeName> and <placeName type= "residence">Mr. Jesserun's house</placeName>.
                  <persName key="murderer">He</persName> had <objectName type="clothing">flat shoes</objectName> on, I know
               that.</p>

            <p>POLICE: You think it was a man's steps?</p>

            <p> JEWETT: Yes. When I came in after she rang the <objectName type="bell">bell</objectName> I heard
                  <persName key="murderer">him</persName> move around just as she rang the
                  <objectName type="bell">bell</objectName> for me, and I went up and walked in and then I came
               out from the <placeName type="house">dining room</placeName>, then was I heard
                  <persName key="murderer">him</persName> walking, I thought <persName key="murderer">he</persName> walked in
               between <placeName>the buildings</placeName> and between <placeName type="house">the
                  garage</placeName> and <placeName type="residence">the house,Mr. Jesserun living in</placeName> * *
               and then I cleared out the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> and as I cleared out the
                  <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> and was going to take out the
                  <objectName type="decoration">tablecloth</objectName> was then I heard the shot. Yes, <time>in the
               morning</time>, the <time>next morning</time> * * * around the back in <placeName type="passage">the alley</placeName> *
               * * I heard somebody coming behind me. I turned my head, I saw <persName key="howardFellows">Mr.
                  Taylor's man</persName> who drives <objectName type="vehicle">the machine</objectName> and he said "Good morning." He was
               in a great hurry and I thought well, he is late * * * because he is supposed to have
               <objectName type="vehicle">the machine</objectName> out I guess before <time>8 o'clock</time> in front for <persName key="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> ** I guess just about <time>8 o'clock</time>. (Witness quoting
                  <persName key="faithMaclean">Mrs. MacLean</persName>) She says "Come up stairs". I says "All right."
               I come up stairs. She says "<persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was shot last night."
               "Oh' I said "Was he, that is what I heard," and she said "Yes." I think I said to
                  <persName key="faithMaclean">Mrs. MacLean</persName> "That is <persName key="murderer">the man</persName> I heard in <placeName type="passage">the
                  alley</placeName>. POLICE: Are you sure <persName key="faithMaclean">Mrs. MacLean</persName> told you
               when you went up-there ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äî you say at <time>8 o'clock</time></p>

            <p>JEWETT: <time>In the morning</time>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Are you sure <persName key="faithMaclean">Mrs. MacLean</persName>told you at that time
                  <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> had been shot? JEWETT: Yes.</p>

            <p>POLICE: What time of the day was that?</p>

            <p>JEWETT: <time>8 o'clock in the morning</time>.POLICE: Can you think of that remark
                  <persName key="faithMaclean">Mrs. MacLean</persName> said "<persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> is shot."
               Didn't she say, "<persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> is dead."</p>

            <p>JEWETT: No, she said "<persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> has been shot."</p>



            <p><persName key="charlesMaclean">CHARLES DOUGLAS MacLEAN</persName>, Neighbor Statement taken
                  <date>2-9-22</date> at ten MACLEAN: M.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: I told the <persName key="law">officers</persName> what occurred the <eventName type="death">night
                  of the murder</eventName> * * I was late for <eventName type="meal">dinner</eventName>. I 'was
               5 minutes late. We had <eventName type="meal">dinner</eventName> at <time>7 o'clock</time>. I must have taken another 5
               minutes to get ready. We sat down I should judge <time>10 minutes after 7</time>. We
               sat there and I guess it took a half hour to eat dinner.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: So I immediately after <eventName type="meal">dinner</eventName> got up from the
               <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName>, went <placeName type="house">upstairs</placeName> to get the
                  <objectName type="appliance">heater</objectName>. I went in the <placeName type="house">front room</placeName>
               and lighted the gas <objectName type="appliance">radiator</objectName>. Also lighted the gas
                  <objectName type="appliance">radiator</objectName> in the <placeName type="house">backroom upstairs</placeName>,
               and I went in the <placeName type="house">front room</placeName> and got my house
                  <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName> and put it on and went into the <placeName type="house">bath
                  room</placeName> and detached the <objectName type="appliance">heater</objectName>, when I heard
               the noise or explosion, it sounded like a shot. (Speaking of <persName key="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor's</persName> body on the morning of its discovery.)</p>

            <p>POLICE: What was the condition of the <objectName type="clothing">clothing</objectName>, if you know.
               Was it disarranged at all?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: No, not at a11. He looked immaculate.</p>

            <p>POLICE: How was he lying?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: He was lying flat on his <objectName type="bodypart">back</objectName>, his <objectName type="bodypart">feet</objectName> separated a little, his <objectName type="bodypart">legs</objectName> apart
               and his <objectName type="bodypart">hands</objectName> at his sides, lying perfectly on his <objectName type="bodypart">back</objectName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Why is <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName> appeared to be arranged you may say,
               just like he was laid out by friends.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Yes, he was perfect.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: As I remember the <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName> laid perfectly along his
               <objectName type="body">body</objectName>. It wasn't thrown back over or anything.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Was his <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName> buttoned?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: I don't think so.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: He looked just like a <objectName type="prop">dummy</objectName> in a
                  <placeName type="store">department store</placeName> or in a <objectName type="house">window</objectName> of
               a <placeName type="store">store</placeName>, so perfect, so immaculate. I remember I was impressed
               with the fact he looked like a <objectName type="prop">wax figure</objectName> dressed up.</p>




            <p><persName key="faithMaclean">MRS. FAITH MACLEAN</persName>: neighbor Statement taken on <date>2-9-22</date> POLICE:
               When did you first learn that <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was dead? </p>

            <p>MACLEAN: At <time>7:30</time>
               <date>Thursday morning</date>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Who was it that brought it to your attention?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: <persName key="peavey">His colored servant</persName> came screaming out of
                  <placeName type="residence">the house</placeName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: What did he say?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: "Help, <orgName type="law">Police</orgName>, <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> is
               dead."</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did the fact that <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor</persName> was dead remind you of
               anything that occurred <eventName type="murder">the night before</eventName> * did you hear a
               shot.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Yes, what we thought might be a shot or a <objectName type="vehicle">muffler</objectName>
               explosion, I do not know which.</p>

            <p>POLICE: When did you hear that?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Sometime probably between <time>quarter of eight and eight o'clock</time> on
                  <date>Wednesday evening</date>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Now, at the time you heard this shot did you go out on <placeName type="house">the
                  porch</placeName>?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Yes, shortly after *** oh, about, I suppose three or four seconds, maybe a
               minute.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: No I did not I just opened my <objectName type="house">front door</objectName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Well, what did you say?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: I saw <persName key="murderer">a man</persName> had already opened the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName> of
                  <placeName type="residence">Mr. Taylor's house</placeName> and was looking towards
                  <placeName type="location">Alverado St</placeName>. *** I didn't see <persName key="murderer">him</persName> open the
                  <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>; it was already open I think.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Which way was the <objectName type="door">screen</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: The <objectName type="door">screen door</objectName> was open. I think the
                  <objectName type="door">screen door</objectName> was open then it must have been to have seen
               <persName key="murderer">his</persName> figure as clearly as I did.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did <persName key="murderer">he</persName> shut the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: It seems like <persName key="murderer">he</persName> shut the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>. It seems like <persName key="murderer">he</persName>
               leaned in and pulled it closed.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: So it must have been opened because I distinctly saw <persName key="murderer">his</persName>
                  <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: You are satisfied are you, that the light came from <placeName type="scene">Taylor's
                  apartment</placeName> out on <placeName type="passage">the street</placeName> through the
                  <objectName type="passage">open door</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Yes.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did <persName key="murderer">he</persName> seem in a hurry?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: No, <persName key="murderer">he</persName> was the coolest thing I have ever seen * * *. <persName key="murderer">He</persName> turned around and
               looked at me and hesitated. Then it seems as if * * * that <persName key="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName> must have spoken to <persName key="murderer">him</persName> from inside <placeName type="scene">the house</placeName> 
               *** <persName key="murderer">he</persName> thought he had spoken and he didn't. Seemed like <persName key="murderer">he</persName>
               pulled the <objectName type="passage">door</objectName> shut, then turned around and looking at me
               all the time, walked down a couple of <objectName type="house">steps</objectName> that go up to <placeName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor's
                  house</placeName> there.</p>
            <p>POLICE: Do you know whether <persName key="murderer">the man</persName> that you saw went to <placeName type="location">Alvarado
                  St</placeName>. through the open court there?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: <persName key="murderer">He</persName> went towards <placeName type="location">Maryland St.</placeName> and towards
                  <placeName type="passage">the alley</placeName> in <placeName type="passage">between the two houses</placeName>
               because <persName key="murderer">he</persName> was facing that way ready to go when I closed the
                  <objectName type="passage">door</objectName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: You knew it wasn't <persName key="taylor">Taylor</persName>.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Oh, I knew it wasn't <persName key="taylor">Taylor</persName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Could you have recognized <persName key="murderer">the man</persName> 1f it had been <persName key="taylor">Mr.
                  Taylor</persName>.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Oh, yes, positively. </p>

            <p>POLICE: Now, is it possible that it might have been this young man <persName key="howardFellows">Howard
                  Fellows</persName>, the chauffeur, that you saw there. Could that be possible.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: I suppose it could be possible but it doesn't seem to me that he was <persName key="murderer">the boy
               or was the man</persName>. He doesn't seem the built of <persName key="murderer">that man</persName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did <persName key="murderer">the man</persName> you saw have a smooth face?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Yes, <persName key="murderer">he</persName> did have a smooth face.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Did <persName key="murderer">the man</persName> you saw have on anything like a <objectName type="clothing">chauffeur's
                  uniform</objectName>?</p>

            <p> MACLEAN: Well, the only thing I noticed was <persName key="murderer">his</persName> <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>,
               something tied around <persName key="murderer">his</persName> throat. I don't know whether <persName key="murderer">the man</persName> had an
                  <objectName type="clothing">over-coat</objectName> or not.</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: <persName key="murderer">His</persName> age I don't know but I should judge <persName key="murderer">the man</persName> was probably between 30 and
               35. <persName key="murderer">He</persName> was about <height>5 feet nine</height>, just about ***, and <persName key="murderer">he</persName> was stocky, not
               fat, but stocky. <persName key="murderer">He</persName> had on a <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName>. It seemed like a checked
                  <objectName type="clothing">cap</objectName> with a plaid in it, and <persName type="clothing">he</persName> wore something around <persName key="murderer">his</persName>
               throat.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Smooth shaven?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: Yes.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Color of <persName key= "murderer">his</persName> <objectName type="clothing">suit</objectName>?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: No, except it was a dark <objectName type="clothing">suit</objectName>.</p>

            <p>POLICE: Now didn't compare in size with <persName key="smith">Mr. Smith</persName>,the
                  reporter here, who is taking this statement? (<persName key="smith">Mr.
                  Smith</persName> was about <height>5' 7 1/2"</height>)</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: No, <persName key="smith">Mr. Smith</persName> is shorter. (The witness names the
               following men: <persName key="king">Mr. Henry King</persName>, <persName key="hamilton">Mr. Mahlon Hamilton</persName>, <persName key="hoyt">Mr. Arthur Hoyt</persName>, <persName key="berris">Mr. Berris</persName> (first
               name Nigle?), <persName key="ince">Mr. Ince</persName>, <persName key="neilan">Mr. Marshal Neilan</persName>. Witness was then asked the following
               questions)</p>

            <p>POLICE: Now then, tell me whether there is any possibility that <persName key="murderer">this man</persName> you saw
               coming out of there was any of the persons that you have mentioned?</p>

            <p>MACLEAN: No, I think not. I think I would have recognized any of those people.</p>

            <p>** when <persName key="murderer">he</persName> came out <persName key="murderer">he</persName> was dressed as my idea of a <objectName type="description">moving picture
                  burglar</objectName>**? ** because I remember thinking perhaps <persName key="murderer">he</persName> might have been
               one of the boys in <persName key="taylor">Mr. Taylor's</persName> company when they go out on
               location. MACLEAN: Not well dressed. I don't know as I would say slovenly but I don't
               think <persName key="murderer">he</persName> was well dressed.</p>
