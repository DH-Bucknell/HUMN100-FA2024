            <p> It was divulged that <persName key="carl" ref="#family">Carl Stockdale</persName>, veteran
               character actor and close friend of Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Charlotte
                  Shelby</persName>, mother of <persName key="mminter" ref="#actor">Mary Miles Minter</persName>,
               screen star who collapsed at news of <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor's</persName> death, had
               admitted that he was in the company of Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName> at the time
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor</persName> is believed to have been murdered.
                  <persName key="stockdale" ref="#actor">Stockdale</persName>, interviewed at his home, <placeName type="residence">6325 Fountain
                  Avenue</placeName>, chuckled when asked for his own conclusions on the long
               unsolved murder.</p>

            <p> "So <persName key="fitts">Fitts</persName> thinks I killed <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">William
                  Desmond Taylor</persName>," he remarked. "I'll tell you this, I was never in
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Bill Taylor's</persName> <placeName type="residence">home</placeName>. I met him at a <eventName>big party</eventName> thrown by Mrs.
                  <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName>." Pressed for his own suspicions of the killer's
               identity, <persName key="stockdale" ref="#actor">Stockdale</persName> promptly answered,
                  "<persName key="sands">Sands.</persName>" He keyerred to <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor's</persName>
               one-time chauffeur [sic], <persName key="sands">Edward Sands</persName>, whose
               mysterious disappearance immediately after the murder and before authorities could
               question him, has caused his name to be listed among those "wanted for questioning"
               by <persName key="law">police</persName>. The veteran actor, now 63, declared he was with Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Charlotte
                  Shelby</persName> at her home the <eventName>night was murdered</eventName>
               February 1, 1922. He fixed the time of his <eventName>visit</eventName> from 7 to 9
               p.m. Police have set the hour of the shooting at <time>7:45 p.m.</time> "I told my brother,
                  <persName key="type">Frank</persName>," <persName key="stockdale" ref="#actor">Stockdale</persName> said, "that I was

            <p>
               <persName key="stockdale" ref='#family'>Stockdale</persName> said he first met Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName> in
                 <placeName type="city"> Santa Barbara</placeName> at the time when her daughter, <persName key="mminter" ref="#director">Mary

            <p><date>June 10, 1937</date> <orgName key= "news">LOS ANGELES TIMES</orgName></p>

            <p> While authorities deferred definite action yesterday in the investigation into the
               fifteen-year-old murder of <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">William Desmond Taylor</persName>, a 63-year-old
               film character actor stepped forward to make the most important statement to be added
               recently to the mazes of <placeName key="city">California's</placeName> most famous murder
               mystery. The new figure in the case is <persName key="stockdale" ref="#actor">Carl Stockdale</persName>, for years
               well known as an actor in Hollywood and who now lives at <placeName key="street">6325 Fountain
                  Avenue</placeName>. </p>
            <p>Disclosing that he had been a close friend of Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Charlotte
                  Shelby</persName>, mother of <persName key="minter" ref="#actor">Mary Miles Minter</persName>, the latter,
               who admitted she was in love with <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor</persName> at the time of his
               slaying, <persName key="stockdale" ref="#actor">Stockdale</persName> had this to say yesterday: "I have expected
               the authorities to question me for some time and have made no effort to evade such
               interrogation despite the fact that no one welcomes publicity of the sort. </p>
            <p> "I was with Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName> on the night that
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor</persName> was murdered at about the time fixed by the
               authorities that the fatal <objectName key="gun">bullet</objectName> was fired. That may be
               considered of importance to the authorities and is information I am quite willing to
               give." </p>
            <p><persName key="stockdale" ref="#actor">Stockdale</persName> indicated that he is in complete sympathy with a
               statement recently issued by Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#actor">Shelby</persName> in which she declared
               that, sick of the innuendoes which have followed in the wake of the
                  <persName>Taylor</persName> murder, she wanted action to clear up the case once
               and for all.</p>

            <p>Although apparently unwilling to move at once, the <placeName>District Attorney's
                  office</placeName> yesterday stated that <persName key="stockdale" ref="#actor">Stockdale</persName> is scheduled to be questioned
               before the present investigation is concluded.</p>

            <p> "I am willing to tell all I know to the District Attorney or anyone else," commented
               the actor. "I have known Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName> and her family for
               approximately twenty years. I was living on <placeName key="street">Winona Boulevard</placeName> with my brother
                  <persName key="frank">Frank</persName>, and my mother and father on the day of the
                  <eventName type="gun">shooting</eventName> of <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor</persName>. "In the evening I
               left my home and went to pay a visit to Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#actor">Shelby</persName> in the new
               house she had purchased at <placeName>Seventh street and New Hampshire
                  avenue</placeName>. I arrived shortly before <time>7 o'clock </time>in the evening and left
               about 9 o'clock."</p>

            <p><persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor</persName>, as near as authorities could fix the time, was shot
               about <time>7:45 p.m.</time> on <date>February 1, 1922</date>. Several persons in the neighborhood of his
               bungalow at <placeName type="adress">404-B South Alvarado street</placeName> reported hearing a
               shot at that time. </p>
            <p>"I was the first person," went on Stockdale, "to inform <persName key="cshelby">Mrs. Shelby </persName>that <persName key="taylor">Taylor</persName> had
               been killed. That was about <time>9 o'clock</time> the next morning. I had gone to the studio
               where I was working on a picture with <persName key="normand" ref="#family">Mabel Normand</persName> and some one told me that <persName key="taylor">Taylor</persName>
               had been found dead. I telephoned Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName> at once because I
               knew that he had been <persName key="minter">Mary's</persName> director and that the whole family
               knew him well." </p>

            <p> When a <objectName key="gun">bullet</objectName> snuffed out the life of <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">William
                  Desmond Taylor</persName>, noted picture director, in <date>1922</date>, Mrs.
                  <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Charlotte Shelby</persName> was at home. </p>
            <p>
               <persName> key="stockdale"ref="#actor">Carl Stockdale</persName>, veteran actor and friend of Mrs.
                  <persName>Shelby</persName>, so testified in Superior Judge <persName key="wood">Parker
                  Wood's</persName> court yesterday.</p>

            <p> He appeared as a defense witness in trial of the civil suit by which <persName
                  key="margret" ref="#family">Margaret Shelby Fillmore</persName>, Mrs.
                  <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby's</persName> daughter, is seeking to regain $48,750 in bonds,
               which she contends her mother removed from a joint safety deposit box.</p>

            <p> "I was with Mrs. <persName> key= cshelby ">Shelby</persName> from <time>7:30 to 9:30 p.m.</time> in her apartment
               at <placeName key="location">Seventh street and New Hampshire avenue the night</placeName> of the
               murder," <persName key="stockdale" ref="#family">Stockdale stated.</persName>
            </p>
            <p>"I did not know of the tragedy until the following morning when I arrived for work at
               the <orgName type="studio">Mack Sennett Studios</orgName>. </p>
            <p>"I immediately called Mrs. <persName key="cshelby">Shelby</persName> and told her to prepare
               herself for a shock. Then I told her Mr.<persName key="taylor" ref="#actor"> Taylor</persName> had been slain. </p>
            <p> "She screamed: 'Impossible!' "</p>

            <p> The actor's testimony, while perhaps not strictly pertinent to the present
                  <eventName>suit</eventName>, was introduced to answer certain pointed intimations
               made during its trial, attorneys explained.</p>

            <p>
               <persName key="minter" ref="#actor">Mary Miles Minter</persName> and the late <persName key="normand" ref="#actor">Mabel
                  Normand</persName> frequently were mentioned in gossip concerning the
                  <persName key="taylor" ref="#actor">Taylor</persName> mystery, <persName>Stockdale</persName> said. But at
               no time had he heard rumors that Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#actor">Shelby</persName> might be involved
               as a suspect, he added. </p>

            <p> The actor also testified that he had seen Mrs. <persName key="fillmore">Fillmore</persName> under
               the influence of <objectName key="drink">liquor</objectName> four times between <date key="year">1925 and 1931</date>. </p>
            <p> --- <date>August 26, 1937</date> <orgName>LOS ANGELES NEWS</orgName></p>

            <p>...<persName> key='stockdale' ref='#actorStockdale's </persName>testimony was in the nature of a reply to that of
               Mrs. <persName key="fillmore">Fillmore</persName> two days ago when she said she did not know her
               mother's whereabouts at the hour of the murder. Cross-examined as to whether he had
               ever heard that Mrs. <persName key="cshelby" ref="#family">Shelby</persName> was a suspect in the murder, the
               veteran actor replied, "I did not hear any such rumors, but I did hear rumors that
                  <persName key="mary">Mary</persName> (Miss Minter) and <persName key="normand" ref="#actor">Mabel Normand</persName>
               were suspected of the murder." ~~~~</p>

               lying perfectly natural as though he was simply laid out as a corpse. *** but the
               body was lying parallel with the <objectName type="furniture">desk </objectName>with the feet to the

               the <objectName type="furniture">rug</objectName> near his <objectName type= "bodypart">foot</objectName> was pushed
               back a little bit *** and the <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName> upright and this
                  <objectName type="bodypart">foot</objectName> under it and the <objectName type="furniture">chair</objectName> at
               the <objectName type="furniture">desk</objectName> wee pushed just partially under the
                  <objectName type="furniture">desk</objectName> ** and the <objectName type= "furniture">chair</objectName> right
               between his <objectName type="bodypart">head</objectName> and the <objectName type="furniture">desk</objectName>.
               Well, on the <objectName type="furniture">table</objectName> was a <objectName>check book</objectName>

            <p> Q. There was no chance for anybody at straightening this body out between the time
               the colored boy hollered and you went in there. </p>
            <p> A. No, the only part of his body I touched was this <objectName type="bodypart">arm</objectName> and
               it was absolutely stiff.</p>

            <p>Q. How about his <objectName type="clothings">coat</objectName>?</p>

            <p>A. It was as straight as if it had been pressed. ** and it was absolutely pulled
               perfectly straight. </p>
